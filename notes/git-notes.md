# Git

## Comments

For now we will all work in individual branches, <main> will remain ‘clean’ and only with files and work we all need.

## Commands

`git branch` → see your current branch

`git switch <branch_name>` → switch to specific branch

### Merge changes from main into your individual branch:

1. `git switch main`
2. `git pull`
3. `git switch <your_branch>`
4. `git merge main`
