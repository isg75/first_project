#  Humans vs Machines: Is AI Really Taking Over?

This project explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the future of human employment. Using employment data, industry AI adoption rates, and public sentiment from social media, we investigate how automation is changing—rather than replacing—the workforce.

##  Business Problem

As AI adoption increases, many fear it will replace human workers.  
But is automation truly leading to widespread unemployment?  
Or is it simply reshaping work, requiring new skills and roles?

---

##  Hypotheses

1. **H1:** Public sentiment on AI is increasingly negative
2. **H2:** AI-adopting industries show productivity gains but shrinking workforce growth  
3. **H3:** Automation risk correlates with higher unemployment 
4. **H4:** Creative roles are less automatable

##  Datasets

- **`occupation_growth.csv`** – Employment percent change (2023–2033) by occupation  
- **`occupation_wages.csv`** – Hourly and annual wage data by occupation  
- **`country_ai_adoption.csv`** – OECD industry-level AI adoption rates  
- **`ai_job_sentiments.csv`** – Reddit comments and sentiment labels on AI and jobs  

---

##  Tools & Techniques

- **Python libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, spaCy, wordcloud  
- **EDA:** Data visualization, descriptive analysis, keyword trends  
- **NLP:** Lemmatization, sentiment classification, stopword filtering 
- **Data cleaning:** Column normalization, duplicate removal, missing value imputation

---

##  Key Insights

-  **Jobs with high automation risk** are shrinking—even in low-AI industries  
-  **Creative roles** are growing, showing resilience and lower automation exposure  
-  **AI-adopting sectors** may boost productivity while slowing job growth  
-  **Reddit sentiment** is mostly negative, filled with anxiety-driven language like “burden,” “delete,” and “replace”

---

##  Learnings

- AI is not replacing everyone—it’s **reshaping work**, especially routine jobs  
- **Clean data** and NLP preprocessing are crucial for accurate sentiment analysis  
- Public perception often **lags behind** what the data reveals
