AB Testing was group project that me and 3 other colleagues had to complete during our fifth week of the  bootcamp. 

Dataset provided by IRONHACK.

We did the data cleaning using pandas functions: Then we export it as a CSV.


Afterwards, as part of the project, we created a presentation in which we shared the step that we took to finish it and the results. The presentation can be found here:
