# Stock Market Analysis

# Introduction
This project aims to analyze the stock price data of both financial and technological companies, offering a deeper understanding of price volatility and changes over time. By examining the price movements during major economic events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and interest rate changes, the project seeks to uncover the factors that influence stock price fluctuations.

The analysis focuses on understanding how different industries respond to economic shifts, comparing the volatility of technology companies with financial firms.

**Hypothesis 1**:
The stock prices of technology companies are more volatile than those of financial companies, leading to larger price swings over time.

**Hypothesis 2**:
Major economic events, such as interest rate changes or inflation reports, lead to significant fluctuations in JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s stock price.

Through this exploration, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of stock prices, offering a clearer picture of how external factors drive market behavior in different sectors.

# Conclusion

One of the key findings from the analysis was that volume raised exponentially during periods of high uncertainty, particularly during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and in response to significant interest rate decisions. This surge in trading volume aligns with increased market volatility and can be attributed to heightened investor fear and speculation.

In conclusion, this analysis not only confirms the hypotheses but also highlights the complex interplay between sector-specific characteristics, economic events, and market volatility.
