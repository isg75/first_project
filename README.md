# Data_Hub - Global Innovation Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Data_Hub** repository! This is part of a group project to provide clean, structured data and in-depth analysis on global innovation trends. Our mission is to support researchers, policymakers, students, and organizations by offering valuable insights into innovation metrics and their relationship with economic variables.

The goal is to act as a bridge between institutions participating in Global Innovation Systems (GIS) and to help direct attention and resources toward research and development investments that drive positive externalities and foster innovation.

## Business Case

Data_Hub is a startup that specializes in data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Our services cater to a range of customers:

- **Researchers**
- **Policy Makers**
- **Students**
- **Organizations** involved in public-private partnerships, international collaborations, and government incentives to accelerate R&D investment.

We aim to help our clients make informed decisions by providing clean, accessible, and actionable data that can inform R&D investments, policies, and strategies. By contributing to innovation ecosystems, we facilitate the creation of positive externalities that benefit the global innovation process.

## Client Persona

Our client is a representative from a global organization focused on advancing research and development initiatives worldwide. They require accurate and comprehensive data on global innovation metrics for:

- **Pitching** at international conferences.
- **Supporting R&D investments** in various countries.
- **Guiding policy decisions** on innovation and R&D investments.

This repository contains the tools and resources to help our client gather, clean, analyze, and extract insights from global innovation data.

## Project Overview

This repository outlines the steps involved in the **Innovation Process** and the relationship between innovation and economic variables. Specifically, the process consists of:

1. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling** – Preparing raw data for analysis.
2. **Analysis and Correlation** – Exploring the relationships between innovation metrics and economic factors (e.g., R&D spending, economic growth, etc.).
3. **Conclusions** – Extracting actionable insights to help guide innovation policy and R&D investment.

### Tools and Resources

- **Jupyter Lab**: A powerful open-source tool for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: The primary language used for data processing, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Python Libraries**:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `numpy` for numerical operations.
    - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
    - `scipy` for statistical analysis.
    - `pycountry` for working with country data, including country codes, names, and subdivisions.

## Data Sources

This project leverages multiple datasets from renowned international organizations to gather relevant data on global innovation. The key data sources include:

1. **World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) statistics database** – Provides data on patents, trademarks, and industrial designs worldwide.
2. **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)** – Offers data on global education, science, technology, and innovation indicators.
3. **UN Data repository (maintained by the United Nations)** – A comprehensive collection of statistical data on economic, social, and environmental topics globally.
4. **The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) statistics database** – Provides detailed data on education, science, technology, culture, and communication indicators across countries.
5. **Human Development Index (HDI)** – A composite index from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that measures a country's average achievements in health, education, and income.
6. **Binz, C., Research Policy (2017)** – A scholarly resource exploring global innovation systems, providing additional context and data points for the relationship between innovation and economic variables.
