You’ll explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate through military force, diplomacy, trade, culture, influence, and other underhanded tactics.","Sins of a Solar Empire II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed space strategy game that seamlessly blends real-time battle tactics with the depth of 4X. As both emperor and battle commander you must lead one of six playable factions to victory against the threat of extinction! Real-time Tactics meets 4X Depth There are no turns. There is no battle mode. There is no strategic mode. It's all one mode and it's all in real-time. Instantly zoom in to control tactical engagements where every missile, turret, and ship is fully simulated and an important part of the battle. Instantly zoom back out to manage your empire where every asteroid, moon, and planet orbits its parent in a slowly evolving strategic landscape. Unparalleled Gameplay Experiences Sins of a Solar Empire II delivers sprawling empires, huge fleets, and completely new and exciting gameplay moments that can only be found in Sins II. The Surprise: Build a secondary fleet on a rogue asteroid and launch a devastating surprise attack when its orbit brings it behind the enemy's back line. The Body Block: Stall an enemy's home planet bombardment by using your massive titan to body block swarms of missiles attempting to knock out your starbase and its critical planetary shield. The Screen: Advance a screen of point defense flak frigates to protect your fragile long-range cruisers by intercepting incoming bombers and missiles. The Swarm: Maneuver your faster moving ships to pick apart unescorted larger ships. Their powerful but slow-moving turrets simply can't track your agile strike force. The Influencer: Influence a hostile expansionist Minor Faction to secure your border while reserving enough Influence to win an auction for a powerful item to install on your best capital ship. The Backstab: Protect yourself from a backstab by establishing a time locked alliance. But pay attention to the time - your â€œallyâ€ may move his fleet to your doorstep just as the lock expires! Features A Dynamic Galaxy: Planets orbit their stars in real-time causing the galaxy's structure to slowly change, creating new battle fronts and new opportunities. Players can view the state of the galaxy up to an hour in the future to prepare their strategies. 3 Unique Races: It's War Year 35 and the emergent TEC, alien Vasari, and deviant Advent have been forced to adapt and evolve to survive. TEC: The inhabitants of this region of the galaxy, the TEC are humans who have joined together as the Trader Emergency Coalition to combat the alien Vasari empire. They rely heavily on trade to support their industrial base and augment resource income. Vasari: Ten thousand years ago, the Vasari Empire once ruled over hundreds of planets and dozens of sentient species. Now on the run from an unknown enemy they use their mastery of phase space to conquer and acquire resources to continue their exodus. Advent: A civilization of humans who were forcibly outcast by the Traders over a thousand years ago, the deviant Advent have returned with technologically amplified psionics and the power of the Unity - a devastating expression of their collective will. Each race features unique starting conditions, gameplay mechanics, units, abilities, items, and technologies. Their game changing new Empire Systems add a whole new level of strategic capabilities: TEC Trade: The new TEC trade system enables them to dynamically adapt their economy by adjusting the allocation of traded resources on demand. Vasari Phase Resonance: Strategically placed structures collect Phase Resonance allowing the Vasari to customize their global phase mastery effects. Advent Unity: Enables the Advent to harness the collective will of their population, unlocking the full potential of the Unity's global abilities. 6 Playable Factions: The parent races are further differentiated by unique sub-factions each with their own unique features and play styles that reflect their motivations and goals. For example, the TEC: Primacy is a xenophobic 'human first' empire focused on aggression and the Vasari: Exodus is willing to destroy planets to fuel their mobile empire. Combat Simulation: A detailed combat simulation adds incredible depth to tactical gameplay. Turrets with their own pitch and tracking speeds make firing solutions important in battles. Fully simulated missiles can be blocked by ships or destroyed by point defense. New mechanics around shields, armor and hull points give greater depth to units and tactical decisions. Empire Management: All planets and ships can now be easily analyzed, customized, and upgraded in one place without the tedium of finding and clicking through all units in your empire. The Intelligent Construction system will queue up the entire chain of prerequisites to fulfill any item, research, or unit build request. Fleet Management: The new fleet system includes the ability to request specific reinforcements on the fly. Requested units are automatically queued from the optimal factory and rallied to the fleet. Combined with Intelligent Construction this allows you to focus on the important tactical decisions and big picture strategy. Unit Customization: Planet surfaces can now be customized with special items that vary by race and planet type. Capital ships, titans and starbases can also be customized with race specific items to fill gaps in the fleet's composition or target specific strategies. Minor Factions: Numerous minor factions now inhabit the galaxy offering trade, auctions for rare items, and with enough influence, access to their most powerful abilities. Will you befriend them or annihilate them to keep your enemies from turning them against you? Diplomacy: New features include a new offer / counteroffer system, the ability to give or demand planets, and the game changing time locked cease-fires that prevent your 'ally' from backstabbing you until it expires - but keep on eye on the time! Multicore 64-bit Engine: The Sins II engine can utilize all available cores and RAM to maximize performance, now and into the future. Dynamic lighting, physically based rendering, higher resolution textures and more create a beautiful tapestry. 10-Player Multiplayer Support: A cloud based online system supports both 'join codes' and lobbies to make it easier than ever to play with others. Games can now be rejoined in progress if a player drops or has to leave; humans can even take over for AI players if a friend joins late. In-game Mod Support: Mod support has been integrated into the game, making it easy to discover, install, and share mods. Custom maps are automatically shared for multiplayer games, preventing the hassle of everyone downloading ahead of time. Easy to Learn; Hard to Master: With an elegant and intuitive user interface Sins II is easy to pick up and play.

THE STORY OF A SPECIES Meet the Nuggets, a fragile and whacky species that relies on your leadership to build, research, and advance. Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. Youâ€™ve been warned. As you spend time with the Nuggets, you will begin to notice that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs, as well as the ability to act in dynamic and interesting ways. While the beginning of the game will require more management to ensure the survival of your civilization, Nuggets will slowly evolve and learn how to handle more tasks on their own, resulting in you being able to switch over to a more macro-level role and tackle even greater challenges. ORGANIC GAMEPLAY Planets in The Universim arenâ€™t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planetâ€™s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world theyâ€™re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. Itâ€™s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization? NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there! Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planetâ€™s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.

Lead ant colonies against the many fearsome threats of the insect world, while building intricate nests, developing pheromone-based tactics, and evolving to meet growing dangers.","Empires of the Undergrowth is a fast-paced ant colony strategy game. Underground you will excavate your nest, constructing tunnels and chambers to store resources and raise your brood, before venturing above ground. Here, your ants will claim territory, gather resources and overwhelm fearsome creatures. Nest layout, army size and composition along with knowing when to attack or retreat are key to securing victory for your colony of ants. Features Carve out and construct your underground nest to suit your strategy Engage in fast-paced colony versus colony combat above ground Play as different ant species and explore their unique traits and weaknesses Encounter and overpower dangerous beetles, arachnids and other awesome arthropods The Formicarium The fully-voiced campaign in Empires of the Undergrowth has two elements to it, first is the formicarium where you start with just a queen and a few workers. As the game progresses, you will have to withstand the experiments of a mad scientist, growing stronger and genetically adapting your ants to survive his machinations. The Formicarium also acts as a hub in which you can launch scenario missions, which allow you to take control of a variety of ant colonies. To unlock the next tier of scenarios you must withstand the aforementioned experiments. Documentary Scenarios 'Your queen has set up home beneath a rotting log. She is fat, and vulnerable. Her first brood will need to move quickly if the colony is to survive. Their priority now is to find food, and there is plenty around; but there are other hungry creatures in the undergrowth. The workers will need to be vigilant.' Scenarios are narrated from the perspective of a documentary film maker studying the ants, who offers intelligent insight into the goings-on of the colony and the undergrowth beyond. The scenarios are presented in 'tiers' with five planned for the full release (three are currently live). Each tier's missions are presented in a nature documentary style, and vies to be scientifically accurate whilst also being fun to play. Each tier allows you to play as a different species of ant, each with their own differences and play style. The settings for each level also vary, to reflect the environment in which you would natively find that species. Black Ants A recently-mated black ant queen has burrowed into the substrate underneath a log. After giving birth to her first brood, she must rely on them to find food, further excavate her nest, and battle the deadly beetles and spiders that lurk nearby. Wood Ants A wood ant queen takes over the nest of another ant species by dispatching its queen and taking her place. The close proximity to a beach gives the new colony access to the bounty of the sea, but there are many other hungry creatures and rival colonies on these intertidal flats. Leafcutter Ants Leafcutter ants eat only fungus that they grow from leaf cuttings. A fledgling colony must climb and harvest the nearby vegetation, whilst battling praying mantises, rove beetles and marauding lines of army ants. Huge leafcutter majors can be spawned to keep their enemies at bay. Fire Ants Invasive fire ants are carving out an empire for themselves in the swamps. They can link their bodies to build floating pontoons over water, giving them access to unplundered resources. Huge amphibians and dragonflies are some of the many dangers they will face, but fire ants don't get their name idly - their sting more than makes up for their size. --- Freeplay Freeplay mode offers a potentially endless, more open-ended experience than the campaign levels. Once you've mastered the campaign, take your upgraded colony to new challenges. Some freeplay creatures and colonies can be unlocked by completing extra levels. Extra Levels If you want to take a break from the main campaign and the open ended nature of freeplay, there are a range of extra levels to get stuck into, which offer unique objectives and - in some cases - allow you to take control of other species altogether.","English, German, Simplified Chinese, Spanish - Spain, Russian, French, Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Italian, Hungarian, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Ukrainian, Portuguese - Brazil",17.0,"Simulation, Strategy","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",200000 - 500000,317.0,0.0,95,6149.0,336.0,6169.0,1629.0,170.0,1971.0,170.0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

The overlapping blasts from the initial explosion add up to a huge amount of damage at the epicenter, while the seeking clusters handle crowd control. Example Build #2: Celestial Shield-Bomber Hullbreaker + Amp Shield + Volatile Shields + Flash Shielding + Emergency Systems + Celestial Lance This build takes advantage of the Hullbreaker's speed and resilience to crash damage to slam directly into enemies. The fragile Amp Shield is used not for defense, but to augment Hullbreaker's strongest aspects, gaining increased speed and force. The shield will break on impact, but we can capitalize on that using the Volatile Shields mod, which detonates the shield when it goes down, blasting all nearby enemies. Flash Shielding gets it running again quickly while Emergency Systems grant a moment of damage immunity, making charge attacks safer.

Beyond their skills, each family member has traits that determine their personality and capabilities, varied cultural backgrounds that influence how people perceive and treat them, and a wide range of needs and desires to keep an eye on. Dissatisfaction breeds resentment, envy, and disloyalty, and thatâ€™s when the daggers come out. Will you seek to calm tensions through gifts and camaraderie, or will you draw first blood to eliminate any threat to your preferred nobles? Sometimes the blood you draw belongs to your own kin â€“ driven by ambition, greed, and opportunistic thinking, the members of your family will draw blades against each other given the right circumstances. From scorned lovers and power-hungry siblings to family members influenced by foreign kings and queens, trust is in short supply. Your kingdomâ€™s capabilities are determined by what your nobles know â€“ they will individually study ancient texts to learn new technologies, and should they perish, that knowledge will be lost with them (unless recorded or passed along to their students). Acquire books in different languages and read them to unlock new buildings, tools, and opportunities for your kingdom. Ensure more of your family members can learn their secrets, translating the texts into a language they speak as needed, preventing a sudden loss of knowledge resulting from a stray arrow. But will you hoard such knowledge in your libraries? Or will you transcribe these writings to trade to others in exchange for immense wealth and resources? After all, knowledge is powerâ€¦ The common folk of Norland are the backbone of any kingdom, serving their noble lords on the battlefield and around the city with deference and loyaltyâ€¦ until their bellies become empty or the beer runs dry. With different backgrounds, needs, and thoughts of their own, the peasants are difficult to please and easily manipulated into rebellion, crime, and controversy â€“ will you address their complaints as a benevolent lord or answer them with the executionerâ€™s ax? Acting through your nobles, tell your peasants where to work, what to prioritize, and when to fight â€“ though you lack direct control over the lower class of your society, they still have hopes, dreams, and relationships of their own. Managing them carefully is critical for success as they are the ones who maintain the complex production chains of your city and are responsible for building structures, harvesting resources, and producing the very goods that keep them satisfied. Your average peasant will rely on their accrued wealth to lead a fulfilling life. Manage the wages handed out at the end of each day as well as the cost to purchase basic needs like food and beer at the local market to ensure the people stay motivated. High wages and low costs are also an excellent way to encourage migration, but be careful of who you might welcome to your lands. Peasants hail from different cultures, often at odds with one another, and having them coexist in your small city can be challenging. You can use this friction to your advantage at times, but if the populace has an issue with your noble familyâ€™s heritage, you might find hiring additional guards the key to a long life. Some peasants are devout adherents to the Church of Saint Sophia, and will care most for a nobleâ€™s piety, while loyalist peasants simply need enough money to buy food and beer to remain happy. Other factions and sub-factions have different priorities â€“ as you expand and grow stronger, expect these groups to form shifting alliances where they find common ground. Even when theyâ€™re formally on your side, though, their actions and methods might not be to your advantage, and you will never escape the consequences of their separate agendas. When tensions flair, donâ€™t hesitate to establish a nightly patrol, or to give a few unruly members the literal ax. Sending a clear message will often bring the peasants back in line â€“ but do not imagine yourself invincible, as even a great lord is one angry mob away from becoming a head on a pike. Norland is set in a rich world with a vibrant past â€“ its inhabitants form a tapestry of different cultural backgrounds with checkered relations, and the power vacuum left in the wake of the Empireâ€™s collapse has given rise to uncertain times. In the distance, an Unholy Horde grows ever stronger, pillaging and burning all in its path, while elsewhere the Church of Saint Sophia uses faith to maintain an iron grip on vast resources. The Empire ruled over a vast tract of land, and its collapse has left behind many successor kingdoms vying for control. Resources vary from kingdom to kingdom, with each potential starting region providing the player different advantages to harness and challenges to overcome. Send your appropriately-skilled nobles to seek out alliances through marriage, negotiate lucrative trade deals, plot assassinations and kidnappings, and incite rebellions. Will you attempt to recruit spies and conspirators in foreign kingdoms and bring them down from the inside, or do you prefer to settle your differences through force of arms on the open field of battle? And how will you respond when, inevitably, your enemies infiltrate your ranks or bring their armies to your borders? Watch history play out as events and calamities put you in difficult circumstances from time to time, further complicating the intricate tale of betrayal and bravery that the countless nobles and peasants of Norland weave. From kidnapped relatives to plague-infested refugees, from blackmail to natural disasters, your family will be put to the test throughout the years. Do not expect the world to sit idly by â€“ traveling nobles will seek refuge or sow dissent, and just as you can send your family members and envoys out to seek opportunities, so too can the other kingdoms of Norland. Bandits will establish camps in the outskirts of civilization as other kingdoms push for alliances and engage in wars of their own. WIll you join them in their violent endeavors, or work in isolation instead? When all else fails, blades are drawn and bloodshed settles disputes. Raise your citizen militia, motivate prisoners to fight for their freedom, and put your nobles in command to inspire the troops â€“ but whose life will you put on the line when the banners are raised? Dissent and rebellion will see your peasants raise arms against you, and while a poorly armed riot can be crushed by a well-trained and loyal militia, some groups plotting against you will not be so lightly armed, and a succession crisis or power-mad relative may become your greatest threat. Keep public order in check and stay on guard against enemies hiding in your midst. Your warriors are the very people that tend to your fields, brew your ale, and cheer on your executioners â€“ war is not to be taken lightly as valuable lives are risked with each battle. Will you avoid bloodshed at all costs, or are the lives of your people a sacrifice youâ€™re willing to make? The equipment in your warriorâ€™s hands and on their backs must be either imported or manufactured locally, limiting the makeup of your armies based on your economy â€“ plan ahead before declaring war, and before war is declared on you. Defend your home against foreign invaders or march across the world map and dive into all-out battle commanding the forces youâ€™ve raised and armed â€“ morale, combat skills, and tactical prowess can determine the victor, but no one is safe in the chaos of clashing steel. Through a multitude of scenarios to choose from and a plethora of options that define your nobles and the world around you, Norland allows you to build a society and tell a unique story of any kind â€“ warmongers with penal legions fighting for their freedom, highly educated religious zealots trying to spread the faith, wealthy multicultural idealists hoarding tomes of knowledge, treacherous spymasters plotting assassination and intrigueâ€¦ what tale will you tell?","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Ukrainian, Turkish, Russian, Czech, Hungarian",16.0,"Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",100000 - 200000,6139.0,0.0,79,2441.0,780.0,2994.0,1375.0,1375.0,1463.0,1463.0,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

It is on one such expedition that Seign Kesling, a young and gifted imperial officer, and Nowa, a boy from a remote village, meet each other and become friends.

Escort four girls to the prosperous city of Luoyang in a branching narrative with themes of revenge, cannibalism, involuntary servitude, and more on a redemptive journey.","Welcome to join our Discord: During Chongzhenâ€™s Reign (A.D. 1628-1644), land annexation reached unmitigated extremes, the country faced domestic issues and foreign invasions, coinciding with the catastrophic Little Ice Age. After many years of horrid disasters in succession one after another, the Ming court continued to impose inhumane policies resulting in widespread starvation and leading to the rise of multiple rebellions against the court. Liang the bandit, and his companion are commissioned for a job from an unsavory merchant and must escort four girls to a wealthy lord in the city of Luoyang. They must pass through Huazhou, Wenxiang, Shanzhou, and finally reach their destination of Luoyang. Liang initially believes that the girls he is escorting will be sold to the wealthy lord as adopted daughters to begin a new life. However, one of the four girls named â€œSuiâ€ reveals the hidden secret of their journey to Luoyang. The lord is a swine demon who has practiced devouring young ladies for over a thousand years. Every year on his birthday, he dispatches human traffickers to abduct girls from Shaanxi in celebration of his special day. Suiâ€™s sister was among the many who have fallen victim to the demonâ€™s appetite. Sui is hopeful that Liang will end the escort and join her in assassinating the swine demon to avenge her sister, and those who have perished in recent years. Although Liang wants to believe Sui, there are too many inconsistencies in her story. Throughout the journey, Liang will gather information, unravel the truth, and make his decisions accordingly. Play as Liang, the main character and protagonist. His family has run a successful business for years, but Liang never saw himself as his fatherâ€™s successor. Instead, he would rather travel the world as a Knight-errant and visit as many new locations as possible. The day of the Great Tianqi Explosion in 1626, was the day Liang lost everything. After becoming a refugee with nothing left to his name, he turned to a life of crime. Liang became a bandit and makes a living by killing others for loot. Sui, a nine-year-old mute born in Luoyang. Her sister was killed by the swine demon that also dwells in Luoyang. To avenge her sisterâ€™s death, she intentionally let her self-become abducted to get close to the demon and assassinate him. Some, or all of the above statement is false, part of Suiâ€™s untrustworthy nature. Liangâ€™s partner Tongue, the silver-tongued devil who is motivated by greed. When they work jobs together, Liang executes their target's lives while Tongue works on securing loot. A girl from an authoritative family that was abducted by human traffickers. It is said to be a distant relative of governor general Yuan. One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi who was sold by her parents in a year of turmoil. She is full of vigor and an honest person, who cares deeply about her sister. One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi, also sold by her parents. She is charming, pure of heart, and is also very dependent on her older sister. An old friend of Liang, who owns an inn outside of Jinzhou city. In the fifth year of Chongzhen (1633), a rebel leader came to Jin from Shaanxi and called himself the 'Dashing King'. The swine demon disguised as a wealthy lord that devours young girls on his birthday for thousands of years, according to Sui. He is also the one who has commissioned Liang to escort the four girls to the city of Luoyang. There are a variety of different endings and branch options, but good deeds cannot be rewarded during times of war. Pay for the crimes Liang has committed and suffer the consequences.

The locations seem familiar to you on a map, as they correspond to burial sites of the elite Mejai, powerful warriors blessed with unnaturally long life by the high-priest Akar for the purpose of protecting the pharaoh. However, a blessing in life may be a curse in deathâ€¦ Ancient texts mention these warriors turned mad exceeding the bounds of mortality, bringing death and ruin to those around them. To stop them, legend tells of a group of brave Egyptians who lured each Mejai into separate tombs using invaluable relics, and then trapped them inside foreverâ€¦ While this story may be a myth, you feel obligated to investigate, as the historical and monetary value of such a discovery would be beyond your wildest dreams. But be careful - if the legends are true, the Mejai have been sulking in rage all this time, yearning to wreak havoc on humanity as revenge for their imprisonment. Gather your team of archaeologists and treasure hunters in this co-op thriller and discover the truth behind the legend. Play solo, with a group of friends, or find a public match online.

As you choose your escape route in the Navigator, encounters with alien vessels are unavoidable. They will board your ship and attempt to fight their way through different subsystems to destroy the Core. Your SENTRY must thwart the enemy by bringing to bear an arsenal of potent ranged weaponry. Even with the best shooting abilities, holding back the hordes is only possible by deploying traps and turrets - and if all else fails, utilizing environmental destruction to stem their advance; a well-timed shot could vent aliens into space, a closed blast door could buy you time to set up new defenses.

Even if you fail to defend a level, defeat only changes the strategic landscape in the Ship Overview, forcing you to make new decisions on where to make your next defiant stand. As long as there is a surviving SENTRY and the Core remains operational, your skills in combat mean victory can always be grasped from the jaws of defeat. SENTRY aims to carve out its own path in the Action-Defense genre by featuring a campaign where your choices and performance matter. Battles are not one-off events, defeat doesnâ€™t mean replaying a checkpoint. Everything feeds into the ongoing battle for your shipâ€™s survival. A SENTRY is fast, responsive - and therefore powerful. Deployable traps, turrets and environmental destruction opportunities are needed to supplement this power when facing near-overwhelming forces of reactive and aggressive enemies. Successful escapes will need to utilize a mixture of skill and planning, with discovery and upgrading of new equipment providing an edge in combat. Combining all these elements evokes the feeling of being a beleaguered and outnumbered SENTRY.

From conception to production, we have poured countless efforts and sweat into it, striving to bring the best gaming experience to players. But as a small team new to game development, we understand that our experience is limited and there are many aspects of the game that can be improved and perfected. This is why we decided to first test on EA, hoping to gather more feedback, helping us to continuously improve the game, and create a truly outstanding strategy game. Although our team is small and lacks experience, we have never given up our passion for game development.

Without several years of ongoing evolution, it would be meaningless. Based on this philosophy, we will continuously iterate and update our game, focusing primarily in a few directions: Updating the scenario content. We will add more scenarios and historical events from the Three Kingdoms era, approximately one per month, and continue to update. More significant historical periods will be included once the Three Kingdoms scenarios are sufficiently refined. Updating gameplay features. In core gameplay areas such as internal affairs, diplomacy, and warfare, there will be numerous functional updates. New technologies, character relationships, alliance relationships, duels, naval battles, construction, timing and geographical advantages, and other features will be gradually incorporated, making the game feel like a new experience after about half a year. Workshop support. The editor and Workshop will be continuously strengthened, including support for the new content and features mentioned above. We hope players can create even better scenarios and content. Enhancing effects. Approximately every two years, we will modernize the graphical part of the game, bringing it closer to the level of other high-quality strategy games of the same period.","Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",2.0,"Indie, RPG, Strategy, Early Access","Single-player, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,76,0.0,0.0,190.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

After a sudden crash during a routine fishing trip, Bucky ends up on a mysterious island, where his friends appear to be apprehended by a pack of wolves for disturbing the peace. Embark on a puzzle-based adventure, as Bucky wanders the vast island of Nulla Terra, helping his friends work off the damages, fix your boat, and get back home!â€ What is this? Shipwrecked (Or Shipwrecked 64 as the internet has dubbed it) was an old game originating from the late 90â€™s, commissioned by the (at-the-time) beloved Broadside Animation Studio, developed by a relatively unknown game studio, Cogware Games. The game had a very mysterious nature surrounding its launch, as it was only available from August 13th 1997, to August 17th, 1997, receiving little promotion from Cogware, and none from Broadside. This downloadable version of the game is the closest one can get to playing the original copy of the game. We at the SWRC (Shipwrecked Recovery Crew) were lucky enough to get our hands on an original cartridge, dump it, and convert a lot of the code to new software. With help from two of the original developers, we were able to make this game accessible to everyone. Disclaimer: Shipwrecked 64, while portraying itself as an authentic product, is in fact a work of fiction. Some scenes in the game are graphic and violent in nature. Shipwrecked 64 is what people may refer to as an ARG, and will require out-of-the-box thinking, but also travelling outside of the game for answers. It can be very complex at times, and is intended as a community effort of sorts. Forum posts, or even playing in calls with others, taking notes, and other methods are the best way to proceed forward. Features: Two Modes, a 2023 mode and 1997 mode.

A massive energy release transformed the city into an exclusion zone, periodically illuminated by an eerie glow. The government sealed off the region from the outside world with an imposing wall.

Each new story objective requires travel to a specific place, or having enough money to buy a specific upgrade, and the player must find their own way to achieve that. At various points in the plot, new crew members join you. Improve your relationship with them through talking, taking their suggestions, cooking meals and buying rounds of drinks in order to unlock their full storylines. There are nine potential crewmembers, but you can only recruit five in a single playthrough. Play a second time to experience all their stories!

In this dark fantasy adventure you solve intricate cases and unveil abysmal secrets as Inquisitor Mordimer Madderdin.","The Inquisitor is a story-driven, dark fantasy adventure game with action elements, that compels you to face difficult moral choices. The game is set in an alternative version of (religious) reality. Inspired by bestselling Inquisitor book series by Jacek Piekara. Once nailed to the cross and near death, Jesus becomes consumed by utter rage. He breaks free and unleashes violent vengeance on all the non-believers. Centuries pass and now an army of zealot Inquisitors brutally enforce the faith in this blood-soaked Church. You are Mordimer Madderdin, an Inquisitor in God's service, sent to the town of Koenigstein which is plagued by a series of mysteries and sin. Solve the various cases and crimes of those who have transgressed against the faith, all while uncovering the truth of a darker evil from another realm that is trying to enter the world of the living. Be the ultimate Holy Judge and Jury: Your role as an Inquisitor is to maintain order and enforce the faith in God. But the world is full of sinners who have lost their way. Decide the fates of those you judge in multiple story-driven cases and missions. This is a world where morality and what is right have long strayed from each other. So, will you show mercy or undying belief in The Holy Law? A morally tainted, non-linear tale: This is a dark and gritty story centered around a religion preaching revenge and violence. Multiple branching story choices will test your morality. Choose your path and decide what kind of Inquisitor you will be - one of pity or one of retribution - and ultimately what mark you will leave on this world. Enlightened sleuthing: Mordimer has unique skills and abilities that allow him to solve the various crimes and mysteries that have befallen Koenigstein. Track down and interrogate suspects. Discover the hidden truths of the city and its inhabitants. Piece together the evidence and make your final judgments. Delve into the Unworld: Unbeknownst to those around him, Mordimer has the ability to enter the mysterious Unworld. There he can discover the deeper secrets that suspects have tried to hide in their souls. But there is a grave risk when venturing into this world and the dark force which reigns supreme here will do everything it can to destroy you for stepping foot into its realm. Persuasive interrogations: The 1500â€™s remain a cruel era of justice. As an Inquisitor, you have free rein to use whatever methods and tools deemed necessary to persuade suspects to reveal â€˜the truthâ€™. These optional interrogations date back to the times of the real Inquisition and itâ€™s up to you to decide if and how much force to apply to those under your investigation. Let your sword do the talking: Sometimes a tongue just needs to be cut right out in order to loosen it. A full sword-based combat system means various cases will let or even require you to use brute force. Master your blade, find your openings, and use your enemyâ€™s weak points against them.

As old ways of communism are still not rooted out, the state enforcement agencies are weak and corruption is deeply embedded. Money and violence govern. An era well deserving of its name - the wild 90s. Wild 90s in Bratislava: The streets are controlled by mob gangs that are protected by law and not afraid to show their power even during broad daylight. Racketeering, exploding cars and other ways of settling scores are daily occurrences. The ways of the gangs became useful to some government's elites, who utilize them for their dirty work. We have saying back home: The difference between the secret service and organized crime is being blurred. Parties that should oppose each other are now hand in hand in gaining money and power. For the ordinary citizen, the connections are paramount and the only way up. One saying became widely known: 'You don't have what you don't steal.' Not a typical gangster-open world: The player finds themselves in the role of a bald man in his 30s, working for the secret police. As an undercover taxi driver, you are allowed to freely roam the town and check-up on people of interest at close proximity. Features: The game map of Bratislava covers roughly 10 km2 of a lively city. Vivat Slovakia contains more than 20 story missions that are based on real events set in the 90s of the young Slovak Republic after the split of the Czechoslovak Federation. The game contains professional Slovak voice-over with the main character voiced by MariÃ¡n Labuda. We have prepared English subtitles for Erasmus participants, who tasted the beauty of Slovakia as well as for immigrants from the Iron Curtain period. Over 30 unique period vehicles inspired by their real life counterparts roam the streets. From old socialist scrap to exclusive import cars that only bosses could afford. More than 5 functional and carefully selected local weapons. In Slovakia, pleasant boys will not hit you over the head with a baseball bat, but with a telescopic baton. Experience a slavic open world glory from the unique perspective of a secret police officer. Vivat Slovakia is also being created thanks to successful crowdfunding: Many players will have their own mini stories in the game or will be able to meet them as they walk around Bratislava or act as drivers of public transport in the form of their own NPCs. We transformed the real businesses and homes of our players into game form and incorporated them into virtual Bratislava. This is what product placement should look like in a game.

Just remember: when it comes to this puzzle type, it's important to think way out of the box! A girl found herself stuck in an underground mall, with a body and some turtle soup lying around. She seemed to be caught in a mysterious loop. Could you help her get out and solve the mysteries? A boy lies dead on a sidewalk, with only his underwear and an umbrella in his hands. What happened? A stewardess helped splint the pilotâ€™s broken legs, and brought him fresh seafood every day. However, it seems the pilot is very scared of the stewardess. Why? A big chunk of Turtle Soup are suspenders and thrillers with some dark styles, and others are fun, humorous.

Experience our unique sanity system that takes survival to the next level.,"/ What was supposed to be a nice winter hike in the Mount Washington State Park with friends, turned into a dire situation. You are left alone to fight for your survival. With only marginal supplies you have to fight off of the cold, thirst, hunger, wildlife and your own state of mind while finding your way to an abandoned ranger station in hope to be able to call for help. Winter Survival is a fully fledged survival game even going into Early Access, with dynamic combat, stealth, base building and its unique sanity system just to name a few. Multiple game modes and difficulties allow you to experience the game differently and tailor it to your taste. Venture through snow-covered forests, mountains, and frozen lakes. Grapple with treacherous terrain, deadly animals, and harsh winter conditions. Find shelter, cook meals, and rest, ready to face the next day. Hope it wonâ€™t be your lastâ€¦ You are not the first person to visit this area. There have been many before you. More than a century ago some even lived here. If you explore your surroundings you may find things they left behind that will still be useful to you. Explore various areas and discover their story, like a town built by people who are long gone. Force open doors, avoid traps, and make abandoned structures work again. Find personal belongings as you dive deeper into the townâ€™s past. Will you be able to uncover its secrets? Cold, thirst, hunger and physical as well as mental exhaustion are the five major factors you have to worry about. It doesnâ€™t however end there. Injuries and sickness are other factors and then there is the weather . Spending the night in the freezing cold without any shelter is akin to a death sentence and trying to go out in a snow storm isnâ€™t any better either. Donâ€™t forget, weather in the mountains changes quickly and is unpredictable. Further variety comes in with our event system where random events can save your day unexpectedly or make the nightmare even worse. Things do not have to be that bleak or stay that way all the time. The adaptation system allows you to open up new survival skills and strengthen your abilities . And then there is our unique sanity system to make things really interestingâ€¦ The most deviant enemy in a desolate land, is oneâ€™s mind. In Winter Survival you will experience an unforgiving world where itâ€™s hard to distinguish reality from madness , due to the unique sanity system . In reality, your mind becomes a problem way sooner than starvation. It starts with fatigue symptoms, losing your will to continue the struggle up to imagining things and even full blown hallucinations. Fear and the stress associated with it form another layer that can influence your perception and together all these factors make for a highly interesting and different survival experience. Hunt or be hunted. Use the environment to your advantage. Observe your prey, study its behaviour, make and set traps to capture animals. Craft torches to scare away wolves. Make spears to throw at prey and protect yourself from apex predators that surround the area. Given limited resources, think twice before starting a fight. A bear is a mighty predator and going against one with a knife or even a spear might not be the brightest idea. Maybe avoiding the danger or sneaking past a potential encounter is the smarter choice given the circumstance? Gather resources, learn how to craft all sorts of useful things and build shelters and other structures to escape everyday struggles. Some resources are easy to find, some are only available in certain areas, others have to be gained from hunting and some are left behind by those before you. The extended crafting system ranges from simple campfires to cook food to building entire shelters and protective structures wherever you please. It is the crafting and building system that will allow you to slowly transition from unbearable danger to a more manageable environment - if you prepare properly. It is up to you how you want to play the game and we give you 2 different modes to choose from: Story Mode : Learn more about yourself and people long gone while you struggle to survive. Find your friends and get back home. Endless Mode : Take advantage of more resources and crafting options as you try to conquer the world around you.

You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must journey through the cosmos to defeat his nemesis. Each run, you'll build a unique repertoire of spells, passive skills, and magical artifacts.","Rift Wizard 2 is a tough as nails traditional roguelike wizard simulator. You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must journey through the cosmos to defeat his nemesis. Each run, you'll build a unique repertoire of spells, passive skills, and magical artifacts. A massive list of unique spells, skills, and equipment means there are myriads of potential builds to explore, and procedurally generated levels mean every run presents the player with different challenges. Your wizard will grow incredibly powerful by the game's conclusion, but tricky foes will attempt to grind whatever elaborate magical engine you have built to a halt. You must not only consider the end goal of your build, but how you will get there, and how to navigate the challenges along the way without derailing your spellbook into a useless pile of antisynergy. Rift Wizard's unique portal system means the player always has agency over what challenges they face. You choose which levels to visit, where to start, and how to spend your resources. There is no stealth or stair dancing in Rift Wizard: you must face each level head on and obliterate your foes with whatever tools you possess. Rift Wizard eschews randomness and complex combat formulas in favor of puzzle-like simplicity, where every game piece is easily understandable. Every victory is earned, every death deserved. New in Rift Wizard 2 is the equipment system, allowing the player to find unique and powerful items each run that interact with the spells and passive skills in deep and exciting ways. Randomized equipment can perform crucial bridging functions in your build, allowing access to playstyles not otherwise possible: you could for instance, find a helmet that redeals all your ice damage as poison damage, opening up completely new uses for your poison spells. You could find a staff that converts fire damage to free Mercurize casts, unlocking a Mercurize-fire damage build which surely would make no sense in any other run. Or you might just find massive numbers of radius bonuses that make your fireballs way larger than normal. Every run perturbs the balance of the game in a way that emphasizes player creativity and on-the-fly decision making over the execution of pre-existing builds. Rift Wizard 2 adds many new enemies to the game, including massive multitile monsters, new wizards, and procedurally generated variant monsters. You've fought ogres but have you fought Fae Ogres? Lich Ogres? Burning Ogres? Wereogres? Immortal Bone Wizards? Along with the equipment system, the basic game mechanics have been rebalanced and revamped. HP and spell charges are recharged at the end of every level, but potions are much rarer. Damage redeals no longer work through immunity, demanding more carefully diversified spellbooks. SP is much harder to come by in the early game. Spell upgrades are now much more powerful, but limited to one per spell, encouraging bigger spellbooks that spread skill and equipment bonuses over many spells. The goal of Rift Wizard 2 is to continually place the player in high pressure tactical situations that challenge their creativity and analytic abilities, and to create a strategic sandbox that rewards brilliance, experimentation, and adaptation to constantly changing circumstances.

As these ambitions clash, one battlefield sees the end of all hope for peace. Advances in steam and diesel engines have given birth to merciless weapons of destruction, plunging the world into an era of unprecedented technological brutality. Theaters of War This war spans three distinct continents, each offering unique and challenging combat environments, but among them all are charred corpses, bomb craters, and the scars of incessant fighting. The Central Continent boasts swampy terrain and trench-ridden ground, making troop movement difficult and creating tactical challenges. The Eastern Continent is fortified with military bases, creating serious obstacles to any assault. The desert continent is famous for its sandstorms and dunes, which obscure visibility and complicate combat. Most buildings are destructible, allowing for a variety of tactical approaches when assaulting enemy positions and forcing players to strategically think through cover options. Each faction boasts an exclusive infantry arsenal, interesting models, and elaborate designs. You will be able to play missions for the famous RR (rats), FMR (mice), ERS (lizards), and RD (monitor lizards). Unit cards contain important information, allowing you to accurately and effectively control them on the battlefield. The game has elements of dismemberment and blood. The game is in early access and will be improved until it becomes something that can be remembered for a long time.

STORY When I awoke, there was fantasy stuff everywhereâ¸º What kind of adventure could be in store? And will there be any way home when it's all said and done?! It all started after class in the student council room. Takaaki and all his friends had been gathered to test some unquestionably suspicious if not downright dangerous gameâ€”or 'full-body immersive RPG experience,' in the words of its inimitable creator Ma-ryan. The play-test was only questionably voluntary. The game started to launch. A bright flash filled the room... When Takaaki opened his eyes, he was somewhere he didn't recognize. His friends Konomi and Tamaki were kitted out in full fantasy gear, and when he looked more closely, he realized he was too. Were they in the game? Forget thatâ€”how would they get out? Only one lead presented itself. 'In the depths of the dungeon located nearby, there lives the god who created this world...' But who could it be? In search of more clues and hopefully some answers, the party set out into the dungeon... CHARACTERS Konomi Yuzuhara (Voice: Yurina Hase) Takaaki's childhood friend, one year younger, who lives next door. She's fond of fortune-telling and food and has a dog named Genjimaru. Likes to look after people but isn't much good at it. Tamaki Kousaka (Voice: Shizuka Ito) One year older than Takaaki and Konomi, she was always the boss of their motley crew. The heiress of an old family, skilled at cooking, cleaning, martial arts, and academia. Her hobbies include antiques collecting and historical dramas. Very bad with dogs. Manaka Komaki (Voice: Noriko Rikimaru) Takaaki's classmate and class president. Formerly the class vice president. As a big snacker, she's turned a certain storage area into a secret tea room. She isn't very assertive, but has been friends with Yuma since middle school. Karin Sasamori (Voice: Saki Nakajima) A girl who loves paranormal phenomenaâ€¦ and also egg sandwiches. Blessed with boundless curiosity and energy, but doesn't look before she leaps. The founder and fearless leader of the Mystery Club. Join today! Sango Himeyuri (Voice: Sayori Ishizuka) Ruri Himeyuri's older twin sister. One year under Takaaki. A genius at computers and a major fan of red bean butter bread. Lives at her own pace, doing what she wants, when she wants. Ruri Himeyuri (Voice: Konami Yoshida) Sango Himeyuri's younger twin sister. One year under Takaaki. Emotional and unacademic, she practices jealousy and stubbornness as art forms. On the other hand, she's good at housework, and loves Sango more than anyone. Yuma Tonami (Voice: Hitomi Nabatame) A girl who sees everything as a contest: You can win or lose, and she wants to win. She's constantly challenging Takaaki, but almost never comes out on top. She must have been born under an unlucky star. Most things she does backfire. Lucy Maria Misora (Voice: Rio Natsuki) A space alien from Planet Luu, the third planet orbiting 47 Ursae Majorisâ€¦ or is she? She's certainly an odd girl, with her own language and the power to get drunk on soda. Attends classes only when she feels like it, but no one seems to mind. Yuki Kusakabe (Voice: Rina Sato) An old classmate of Takaaki's who thinks everything 'seems like fate.' Never seen without the fancy notebook that she seems to carry everywhere. Likes black tea, though it burns her tongue. Seems to be primarily nocturnal? Sasara Kusugawa (Voice: Ryoko Ono) The student council president, formerly the vice president under Ma-ryan. Afflicted by a strange condition that causes her body to reject food made with love. An unabashed aficionado of soft and slimy animals. Ma-ryan (Voice: Ema Kogure) Real name: Unknown. Age: 14 forever in her heart. Moonlights as a voice actress. Even post-graduation, she comes and goes in the student council office like she owns the place. The definition of a troublemaker. Full of mischief and mysteries. Harumi Kouno (Voice: Kotomi Yamakawa) A girl who transferred in one day and started calling Takaaki 'Darling.' Her true name is HMX-17b Milfa, and she was previously in the body of a teddy bear. She's always arguing with her little sister Silfa. HMX-17c Silfa (Voice: Harumi Sakurai) The youngest of the three maid sisters has a distinctive speech impediment. With a phobia of human interaction, she hides in a cardboard box when she's upset. The maid uniform she always wears comes courtesy of Yuji. Chie Yoshioka (Voice: Kaori Ota) Konomi's close friend, nicknamed Yocchi. She's known Konomi since middle school and Michiru Yamada since kindergarten. Bright and cheerfulâ€”and also weird and kind of nosy, but a good person at heart. Michiru Yamada (Voice: Akira Kasahara) Konomi's close friend, nicknamed Charu. She's known Konomi since middle school and Chie Yoshioka since kindergarten. Normally collected and wryly witty, but her family's work is weighing on her lately. Ikuno Komaki (Voice: Chiro Kanzaki) Manaka Komaki's little sister. She normally uses a wheelchair. Always worried about her sister's trusting nature, she's keeping a close eye on Takaaki, whom her sister is fond of. Cynical and often bitingly sarcastic. Nanako (Voice: Kayo Sakata) An innocent girl who loves Takaaki, or 'Takky,' like a big brother. She's also more of a go-getter than you might expect: in the past, she's roped Takaaki and others into a quest to find a magic user. Haruka Yuzuhara (Voice: Chieko Honda) Konomi's mother, and a sort of second mother-figure to Takaaki. She looks and acts considerably younger than she is and has a wealth of hobbies. Specialties: Killer Curry, thorough discipline, and loving her husband. HMX-17a Ilfa (Voice: Emiko Hagiwara) A maid robot whom Milfa and Silfa can call their big sister. Specially equipped by Sango with software that gives her a people-loving heart. Normally she seems sweet and demure, but don't make her angry!","English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese",3.0,RPG,"Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,132.0,0.0,89,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

The â€œPrincess Makerâ€ series pioneered the social simulation genre, allowing the player to act as a father who raises a young girl, and it continues to be popular to this day. Among the many titles in the series, â€œPrincess Maker 2â€ is the most popular. This year marks 30 years since the original release of â€œPrincess Maker 2â€ (PC-9801 ed.) in 1993. In this title, the graphics were newly redrawn by Takami Akai, who directed production and worked on character design for the original â€œPrincess Makerâ€ series at Gainax. About â€œPrincess Maker 2â€ â€œPrincess Maker 2â€ is a childrearing simulation game in which the player experiences being the father to a daughter granted to them by the stars. They raise the girl for eight years, from ages ten to eighteen. Your daughter grows up to be an adult through various experiences in the game. The girlâ€™s dream is to become a princess, but a wide variety of opportunities await depending on how you raise her. What kind of dream will you make come true for this girl? Redrawing the graphics This title is based on â€œPrincess Maker 2: Refine,â€ released in 2004. Especially important graphics were redrawn by Takami Akai in a style similar to the PC-98 version. The graphics are drawn in high resolution befitting modern game systems, with a commitment to quality in the details. Addition of an opening animation An opening animation by Yonago Gainax has been added to the game. The animation, drawn by a team led by Takami Akai, envisions the future the player will have as the â€œfatherâ€ with their â€œdaughterâ€. Knowing how your daughter is doing is the first step in raising her This title is a social simulation, so it is very important to always be aware of your daughter's status and use this to raise her. In â€œRegenerationâ€, parameters for assessing your daughter's status are always available, so you can check on her at a glance. Check what you should do for your daughterâ€™s future, and raise her carefully. Message from Takami Akai I am deeply grateful to see that â€œPrincess Maker 2â€, which came out 30 years ago, is still so beloved by so many fans that we can release a new version. This time I was finally able to redo the graphics, which I had always wanted to do. Please enjoy the newly redrawn vacations and endings.","English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean",5.0,Simulation,"Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,16.0,0.0,62,70.0,43.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

World introduction The world would be changed forever. On a fateful December in 2019, a viral infection broke out in Tokyo. The new disease spread relentlessly through the country and claimed lives at a rate of 40%, an even higher fatality rate than that of Ebola. Entry and exit routes to foreign countries became heavily restricted, and even the main lines of transportation in Tokyo halted operation. With this state of affairs, the country's capital was blockaded. Without any sign of an effective cure, the virus began to spread from the general public to medical personnel, police officers, self-defense force personnel, and finally the nation's center. Soon the prime minister, chief cabinet secretary, ministry of health and labor, and other key bureaucrats fell victim to the virus and became absent. By this turn of events, the death toll in the country had already exceeded 200,000. Amidst this state of affairs, a new government had to be hastily formed to run the country. The infectious disease specialist who finally discovered a cure for the virus was selected as the new prime minister in honor of his heroism in saving the lives of many. This new prime minister launched a series of countermeasures against the infectious disease as well as economic measures which all proved to be highly successful. At last, the number of infected began to visibly decrease. And so, the pandemic at long last came to a close.",Japanese,1.0,"Adventure, Simulation","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Partial Controller Support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,109.0,0.0,24,10.0,30.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,False

Exploration as you remember it: you can play Archaelund your own way. Take your party of adventurers through a vast open world and explore as you wish, find awesome secrets and run into unexpected trouble, get involved in conflicts or just pursue your own goals and discover what lies beyond the horizon. Unique dual perspective: just as the best classics did, you'll be able to explore the world of Archaelund in immersive first-person, wondering what lies behind each corner of the dungeon. When combat starts, the view seamlessly changes to top-down perspective, and you'll issue orders to your party, placing them over a battle grid to face your enemies in a deeply strategic turn-based combat. Deep and engaging character progression: a career-based system will have your characters start out as street ruffians, squires, hunters or even beggars; later on you can move into new career, including advanced ones like Knight, Loreseeker, Assassin or Battlemage. A character might leave behind its humble origins, but those days might bring in unique talents to your advantage! Deadly battles with a focus on strategy: a non-inflationist, bounded system will ensure that every battle matters, and every opponent is scary. When your characters advance in levels, you'll gain new tactical options to defeat your enemies, not just increased numbers. An expansive world, handcrafted in detail: Archaelund is big enough to lose yourself in; yet everywhere you go you'll meet people to talk to, unique quests to complete, mysteries to solve and, of course, battles to fight and treasures to loot. Background: the Fall and the Exile The Andorian Empire united the whole human race under the same proud banner for millenia, until a magical cataclysm brought the Horrors from another world. The Empire and most of the human race was annihilated in just a few days; only a few hundred ships could escape to the savage island of Varannar, a distant imperial colony beyond the western ocean. The refugees endured the hardships and tried to rebuild their old civilization, but never again stood united under the Imperial banner. The newly founded Exiled Kingdoms bore the scars of the Fall, each of them in a different way. Varsilia, the mightiest and noblest of the Kingdoms, became grotesquely obsessed over Imperial history and preserving its traditions. Ilmarans turned into fanatical zealots of a new faith, while in Thuram, the remnants of the Imperial Wizards established a magocracy that disregards all matters except the arcane, and quickly declined into endogamy. On the west, the Kingdom of Mercia had emerged from the surviving Imperial Legions, establishing a nightmarish rule based on slavery and arbitrary discipline. The four Kingdoms held irreconcilable views and ambitions, and locked together in a small and hostile land as they were, they often plotted against each other or even clashed openly in the battlefield. It seemed as if a perpetual cycle of war, famine and misery would become mankind's unavoidable fate. Archaelund, mankind's new frontier The future of the Kingdoms, however, brightened up generations later when a sea route to the old continent of Andoria was discovered, and it was proved that the Horrors were no more. Most of the old continent appeared to be an uninhabitable wasteland, but finally a vast and fertile coastal region was found: Archaelund. For the first time in a long time humanity left aside the old grudges and obsessions and looked up to the future. Expeditions were arranged, and thousands of colonists, soldiers, adventurers and rogues embarked to Archaelund. The promises of land, riches and Imperial relics excited the imagination and ambition of thousands, from mere farmers to noble second-sons. The re-colonization of Archaelund went on but the Exiles had to face many obstacles they had not foreseen. The Horrors may be no more, but they left behind a scarred world where eldritch energies and warped monsters roam the lands, and imperial ruins are often an unpredictable arcane hazard. Conflict between the Kingdoms is still very alive, and to make things worse, a subterranean race called the Geldryn (once slaves to the Andorian Empire) now aspires to inherit the surface world, and raise against the Exiles with increasing might. Despite all the dangers, Archaelund is still a land of adventure and opportunity. Just like many others before, your party of adventurers has finally saved up enough money to embark and sail East. The Silver Star has crossed the Andor Sea for two weeks, when you catch the first glimpse of the ancient land of your ancestors, unimpressed by its mundane visage.

Blinded to their original belief of maintaining balance amongst all things they transformed into tyrannical desbots. Their malice, brutality, and oppression altered the very nature of Atham. The moment the Crown shattered every creature experienced and was changed by it. This was followed by 5 mysterious objects that fell from the heavens and impacted the world with such force that it created fissures across the realms. Following the 'Sundering' despair invaded the hearts and minds of the people as an unnatural propagation of twisted creatures ravaged the lands searching for those remnants of the Crown. Inevitably this lead to a new conflict, the Divine War, and it has raged on for almost 400 years. Your goal, Champion is to find the remnants of the Crown and restore balance to Atham.

With the aftermath of his last case weighing on his soul and a long-silent cult resurgent, can he solve the crime—or will it become his curse?","A historical detective visual-novel sequel to The Shell Part I: Inferno that spans Japan's pre-war and post-war eras to present a decades-spanning mystery. FEATURES 5+ hours of story Multiple endings Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals Fully remastered with new HD assets In the years before Japan went to war and the world went to hell, amidst the deep snows of the mountainous north, there was a small hamlet known as Hitogata where by ancient custom the residents were prone to worship clay dolls. One night, during their festival, a woman was murdered, and the people came to speak of this as their god's curseâ€”divine retribution for trying to take the power of their god into their own hands. December 1957. It's been nearly two years since Toko Kuchiki was kidnapped from her hospital room. Reiji Tokisaka's little sister Yukari saves a man from suicideâ€”but that man is a victim of the curse's return... Reiji steps in to sever a cycle of obsession that has persisted since before the warâ€”but still struggles with his own obsession with Toko. Meanwhile, a cult rises from the ashes after six years of silenceâ€”but what are they planning? Curses may be the devices of the gods, but it's always human hands that carry their knives. Characters Reiji Tokisaka (Voice: Waruta Higeuchi) A private detective and the returning protagonist from The Shell Part I: Inferno. Reiji is both lazy and sloppy in his personal life but has a strong sense of duty in his work. After losing his fiancÃ©e while working a case, he quit the police force in order to wrestle with his past alone as a PI. These days, he lives with his sister Yukari. He continues to search for a girl who was kidnapped after getting involved in his investigation of the Girl in Shell case. Tomoyuki Masaki (Voice: Masato Kawamura) Another protagonist, a jobless man whom Yukari Tokisaka prevented from ending his life in Inokashira Park. After leaving the hospital, he's been temporarily employed as an assistant at the Tokisaka Detective Agency. He has currently lost some of the use of his left hand due to the method by which he attempted suicide. Yukiko Kayahara (Voice: Sara Ayumi) A newly transferred member of Yukari's class at Oba Girls' Academy. She seems to tend to avoid other people because she's quiet and a little awkward. This has left her isolated, but Yukari and her friends' warm welcome is beginning to melt the ice of her heart. Yukari Tokisaka (Voice: Rino Kawashima) Reiji Tokisaka's perfect little sister. Flexible and tolerant without being a pushover, she's the quintessential Japanese woman and always happy to look out for her brother. Her one flaw is a disturbing fondness for insects that even her friends have to fear. She's moved up a year since The Shell Part I, but still remains a proud member of the Art Club. Kyoko Hazuki (Voice: Kaname Yuzuki) The personable and supportive owner of the Moon World cafÃ©. A childhood friend of Reiji's, and nowadays more than just a friend. Michiru Shirosaki (Voice: Honoka Imuraya) An odd girl with a mysterious energy. Everything she says and does can only be described as eccentric; the way she talks to the stuffed rabbit she carries around can be misleading, because she's actually remarkably intelligent. Satsuki (Voice: Mahiru Nozuki) A kimono-clad girl who arrived in Hitogata shortly before the festival as a 'guest' associated with the Shigusa family. Typically silent and always mysterious, she also gives off the impression of being somehow fragile and breakable. Karen Hinagami (Voice: Karen Shiina) The younger twin sister of Ayato Hinagami, whom she loves for his quiet kindness. Karen is fascinated with style and fashion. Meguri Takamiya (Voice: Kana Yoshikawa) A childhood friend of Ayato and Naori's, and the same age as the Hinagami twins. Able to make friends wherever she goes, she sets the mood among the group. It seems she also harbors some special affection for Ayato, and she often gets excited over fashion magazines with Karen. Yuu Futami (Voice: Kei Aikawa) The next proprietress of the Futami Inn, the only hotel in Hitogata. As her parents are both deceased, she was raised by its current proprietress, her grandmother Yoshie. Perhaps that is what has made her so dutiful, serious, and difficult to please. Her work assisting at the inn may also be what has made her the most mature of her friend group. Ayato Hinagami (Voice: Tomokazu Otosaka) The grandson of Hidetomi Hinagamiâ€”the absolute authority in the hamlet of Hitogataâ€”and the older twin brother of Karen Hinagami. As the child of such a prestigious house, he was always under social pressure from those around him, and spent a great deal of time painting on his own. Naori Kuroya (Voice: Chugo Mayama) A cousin and childhood friend to Karen and Ayato who possesses a strange but insightful way of thinking. Set to inherit his father's clinic, he's studying hard to become a doctor. Naori is also the one who came up with all of his friends' nicknames.","English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",3.0,"Adventure, Simulation","Single-player, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,0.0,0.0,98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

He came from a lowly background, but with his incredible luck, he rose to the top. And even at the peak of his life, he chose to retire and live a peaceful life with his seven wives.' - This was the response from the little D, who claimed to be sick during college military training and spent the time reading all of Jin Yong's novels. Years later, the old D finally realized that ordinary people don't have any 'cheats' in life. His interactions with characters from novels were limited to their backgrounds. The girl he had a crush on in high school ended up with a bad boy. The campus beauty queen in college chose his muscular athlete roommate. His colleague invited him over for dinner at the house of the girl he had a secret crush on. On Christmas, he confessed his feelings to a gorgeous girl only to find out she was his friend's ex-wife. When a lovely designer from Taiwan had to go back to her hometown, all he could afford was to take her to McDonald's (but it was the best McDonald's ever). If he could turn back time, he would love to tell his younger self that we only live once. Since there is no time machine in reality, can we build one, the kind that allows us to cheat? The old D shared this idea with his greasy friends B and G from the film and television industry over a few shots of strong liquor. With tears in his eyes, they all agreed to make it happen. B bluntly stated that after all these years, they should do something serious. We dug into our own pockets to make this dream a reality and rallied our friends to help. What if we don't have the funds to hire big name celebrities? Well, we turned to our dreams. With our dreams, we were able to secure the friendly appearance of a popular young actress from Taiwan. With our dreams, we were able to convince a team of male producers who were tired of making period dramas to join our project. And with our dreams, we brought on a well-known Chinese music label, Seed Music(Zhongzi Music), to handle all the music production. Our only goal in doing all of this is to recapture the hormone-fueled excitement of youth - to capture the perfect shots of romantic pursuits, to make the process of falling in love sweet and fulfilling, and to give everyone hope in the beauty of love. Games can be restarted, but we only live once. Past regrets can be redeemed here, but what truly belongs to you is only the present. Be brave and love, Xiao Bao.

Well, it has come to me attention ye carousers areâ€¦ how shall I put itâ€¦ not amused with our most recent exploits. I smell the reek of mutiny infesting the lower decksâ€¦ So here I am, your very own, humble Captain: Are you not entertained? Didnâ€™t I treat you well? Was it the abundancy of grog? The brimful barrels filled with tobacco? The caring warmth of a bewitched siren while on shore leave? Or my generosity of splitting the booty fair and square? Enlighten me senses: Is this all you signed up for? Is this the pirate life as you imagined it would be? I challenge yâ€™all: which of you landlubbers dares to speak of mutiny and spill your own captainâ€™s blood to seize control over this ship? Draw your cutlass right now or walk the plank and rest your pitiful existence in silence at the bottom of the seasâ€¦ Let me repeat my vows to this crew and this ship. I promised you an adventure and a life of great risk in return for spoils, riches and eternal fame.

Combining distinct upgrades of your shipâ€™s basic gear, such as weaponry, hull, mast, or figurehead allows for more than 360 unique loadouts.

From building your very own studio, hiring the best in the industry, to sitting in the director's chair â€“ every decision rests upon your shoulders. Be the Director, Even if Clueless Forgot to take the camera lens cap off? That's a 'bold choice in minimalistic viewing,' my friend. Dive headfirst into the unpredictable waters of directing. Make scripts that come to you in dreams, set up scenes that defy conventional logic, and let your unique vision guide every frame. Think of every 'oops' as an 'artistic oomph.' And when the critics scratch their heads, or your lead actor asks why their biggest scene is a silhouette masterpiece, just toss your hair and say it was all part of the grand design. And should your magnum opus not receive the adulation you expected? Well, genius often goes unappreciated in its time. Remember: your film isn't a misfire; it's a misunderstood masterpiece waiting for its moment in the spotlight. Lights, camera, unconventional action! Build &amp; Customize Your Studio Start off with a space that screams 'my uncle's garage' â€“ complete with suspicious stains and a family of raccoons. But fear not!

A Fair Warning JOY OF PROGRAMMING is not a casual game. In fact, it is one of the most difficult games on Steam. It offers the real programming experience: Lots of thinking, hard work, gathering information, debugging and some frustrations. But you will also learn new skills, become a better developer, and most of all enjoy that sweet sensation of finally cracking a hard problem. Open Ended Challenges Real programming: No pseudo code, no imaginary language. Instead, fully functional python code with your favourite packages like numpy, pandas, scipy, pillow, sklearn and more. Some basic prior programming knowledge (in Python or otherwise) and a strong interested in programming is recommended . In-game IDE: A codemirror based in-game Python IDE offers syntax highlighting, auto-completion, docstring tooltips, debugging, auto-indentation, code-folding, copy/paste and undo/redo. Advanced users can also opt to use external IDEs like VSCode or PyCharm instead. Realistic challenges: From robotics to abstract algorithms and creative coding - the full breadth and depth of computer-science awaits. Open puzzle design: Each level has many different valid solutions. Clear goals: Each level has one mandatory goal and up to three optional goals. Immediate feedback: Never wonder whether your code is working. Get immediate, incremental feedback on each good (or bad) step towards a working solution. Performance metrics: Compare your best solution anonymously with others with respect to speed, memory usage and code length. No hard locks: Never get stuck on a single level, there are always several open challenges available. Weekly Challenge: Tackle a different scenario each week and compare your best solutions. Optionally submit your solution and your code to the leaderboards and share it with the world. Designed by a Computer Science Professor The game is developed primarily by a single developer, who also happens to be a computer science professor. An accompanying Youtube series by the developer is in the works to showcase example solutions for each level and walk through them step-by-step. Explaining the reasoning and programming principles along the way to help beginners get into the game and learn actual programming. The series will also feature selected community solutions to discuss other approaches and potential improvements. Level Editor and Modding Support An innovative Python based level editor allows creating and scripting new challenges, which can also be shared via the game's Workshop. Most current levels and all future levels included with the game are created with this editor. Custom assets like 3d objects, sound files, videos and images can be imported easily and used in the level editor. Full modding support to extend the game with custom mod PAKs is planned to be included by the end of Early Access.

The game covers the October 1944 through January 1945 timeframe with a focus on the American sector of the Battle of the Bulge. Combat Mission Final Blitzkrieg allows you to revisit the famous battlefields along the German border, with the wintery Battle of the Bulge as its main focus. It was a time and place where the Wehrmacht was still highly capable at the tactical level, yet fairly evenly matched against the American forces arrayed against it. The mix of harsh weather in an unforgiving rugged environment ensured the fighting was challenging for both sides. Two expansive campaigns offer two very different experiences. One focuses on American forces pushing into Aachen, the first major German city to fall into Allied hands. The other portrays the famous drive of Kampfgruppe Peiper deep into the American lines. Also included are one training campaign, 25 standalone scenarios, and multitudes of Quick Battle maps that will test your tactical acumen and give you easy access to the full range of weather, terrain, and forces from this period and place in time.

Fully interlocked with mouse operation! Her facial expressions and voice changes as you insert her! Her body moves dynamically! Various parts can be switched to make her look the way you want her to look.,"â¤Game System For the first time ever in a doujinshi game for adults, an interactive touch game with characters designed by æœå‡ª Asanagi-sensei! You can't miss the I-balanced (vertical split) illustration of a big-boob girl, which was drawn completely new for this game! As she has grown through her VTuber activities, she has made a lot of enemies because of her cocky attitude. One day, she wakes up in a strange room with a rope around her neck and an unstable foothold under her feet. The game starts from such a situation. This is a faphole simulator in which you train a weak pussy cow Vtuber who moves lukewarmly in Live2D by forcing her to become a slave. She reacts to every operation in real time, and naughty animations are played back. Please enjoy how her whole body shakes dynamically by insertion. Her reactions, breathing, and sound effects are perfectly synchronized with the operations. (There are no mechanically looping motions in this work. All motions are created by special physical and emotional parameters tuned to sex.) You can switch between a variety of parts such as ball gags, ear tags, swimsuits, blindfolds, collars, squirting and spurting amounts, penis-size, tits, hips and thighs. This time, an interactive scenario is included! She is cocky at first, but as the training progresses, you will see her flirting with the cock in a very delicious way. â¤CV: åˆæ­“åž£å¤©éŸ³(@amane_sopra) .

You can also double-click on the following parts of the body to inflict blows. * Head * Torso * Boobs * Thighs Use the blows effectively to advance your training. You can drag and drag each part of the body to play, but you can take the game to the next level by using the multi-recording function. Since multiple recordings allow you to take overlapping shots, you can create your own original animations by combining the movements of multiple parts, such as shaking the body in the first round of recording and manipulating the boobs in the second round of recording. Please try to create your own favorite animation! â¤Emotional Engine! Facial expressions now change automatically according to three parameters: impatience, pleasure, and pain. If you move her suddenly and violently, she will feel more pain than pleasure, and her expression will change to one of pain. It is up to you whether to make her face ecstatic with pleasure or distorted with pain. The emotion meter in the upper left corner of the screen indicates how she is feeling. The emotion meter can be viewed as follows. Heart: Pleasure Yellow rings: Irritation Red rings: Pain (You can visualize the correspondence between the intensity of the stimulus and the emotion by displaying the emotion graph in the settings. Please refer to this if you have difficulty controlling your emotions.) â¤reason, masochism Reason and masochism can be changed by climaxing with pleasure or by climaxing while inflicting pain. Depending on the status of reason and masochistic level, her emotions will change even if you give her the same stimulation. Let's proceed with the training and make her a prisoner of pleasure. â¤Various functions! â– About the login bonus When you start the game, you will receive a login bonus every day (23 hours after your last receipt).

Lost in the Bermuda Void, a strange realm where the ocean is endless and islands fade in and out of existence, seemingly suspended in the time of Dread Pirates. Neither alive nor truly dead, they roam these waters in search of prey. Unless you want to be fodder left in the wake of their mighty ships, you'll have to craft a ship and take to the waves - then conquer the forgotten seas, whose treacherous waters are full of bounty, treasure, and grave danger! Ships are magic in the Void and essential to survival. Even loaded with food, tools, and weapons, every ship can fit down into a bottle - from the tiniest schooner to the greatest dreadnaughts - and be unleashed at a moment's notice! Store away your ship for exploration or keep it as an unwelcome surprise for your enemies. Or even better, craft a custom fleet with a ship for every occasion. Lure in pirates expecting an easy fight, then surprise them with a full broadside from a man-o-war that appears out of nowhere! No ship is complete without a port of call. Land on an island, use the robust crafting and building system to erect a dock worthy of your vessel, then head inland, seeking lost treasures, rare resources, and piecing together the mystery of the Bermuda Void. But be careful: The treacherous forgotten seas can claim the island, just as you reach your prize, leaving you in a heart-pounding race against time to reach the shore and deploy your ship to find safety. Donâ€™t think the prizes will jump in your lap! The Dread Pirates are ancient sailors worth their salt, and the treasures are well hidden. First, youâ€™ll need to assemble an ancient map, torn apart by time and scattered to the four winds. Second, youâ€™ll need to find the spot and brave the dangers of whatever island or sunken ruin it guides you to. Only then can you claim the treasure for yourself and carve out your destiny on the high seas. An intuitive dual-wielding system means fast-paced battles on land and deck. However, the true challenge lies on the high seas, as sail ships clash. Watch your speed, heading, and enemy positions. A mistake might mean that your broadside will fall short and the enemy will turn your prized ship into a mess of splinters and torn sails - just as an oceanic anomaly bears down on your both, with storms, whirlpools, and strange beasts for whom a survivor is a rare delicacy... Between unpredictable anomalies, vicious pirates, and the ever-looming specter of hunger and dehydration, lies the mystery of the void. Where did this anomaly come from? Why does it persist? When will you be able to escape? Can you escape? The answers wait within the storms, in sunken pyramids, amidst wreckage beneath the waves. Build, farm, craft, sail, conquer - then face the ultimate challenge, taking your ship into the unknown and maybe, just maybe, finding a way back to the real world...","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Polish",10.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Simulation, Early Access","Single-player, Multi-player, Co-op, Online Co-op, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Everybody who works at Repulse loves fantasy anime. We are huge fans of shows like Attack on Titan and Full Metal Alchemist. And we also like to play visual novels, especially the ones with erotic and lesbian content. When we finished our last game, we asked ourselves: What if we could combine the elements we love most about anime and visual novels in an interactive VR experience that you could also play without VR. And that is exactly what Iragon is about. You play the game as Darick, a poor kid from a small village. Everything for him changes when he meets a bisexual girl who gets ambushed by soldiers of the Empire. To help her, you must learn to use your magic, but on your quest to bring her home safe, you will have to journey into a dangerous frozen world. Along the way, you will battle enemy soldiers, undead skeletons, and perhaps cross paths with seductive creatures of the frozen land while you unlock new erotic adventures with her. So this is ultimately a game about living out a high fantasy adventure, with a strong emphasis on putting the player in control. The game is meant to be experienced in VR, but we dedicated an equal amount of care to deliver a standard version that will work for players who do not have a VR headset. Features Whether you play in VR or not, you can expect us to deliver: 3 Main storyline romance routes 4 Side romance routes 12 Monster girls you can romance Interactive experiences with your love interests Different outfits Voice acting Motion captured animations A dynamic combat system that features both magic and melee; Destructible environments; A dialogue choice system that influences the response you get. STORY Be the hero, live the story, and go on an adventure of a lifetime while you immerse yourself fully in the world of Iragon, with a complete animated story and full voice acted cast.

Set in a creepy environment and wrapped in a suffocating atmosphere, the game centers on a unique premise: among your collection of dolls, which at first glance seem to be under control, hides an imposter with sinister intentions. As a player, you find yourself in a constant battle against time and your own fears. Each doll exhibits different behaviors, some of which may be critical clues to identifying the impostor. However, discerning between harmless mischief and signs of true danger becomes an overwhelming challenge. The game introduces an element of psychological survival: each time the guardian (the player) sleeps, the clock advances one hour. The tension rises as dawn approaches, with the goal of uncovering the impostor before 9 a.m. If by this critical moment, you have not successfully identified the only candidate as the impostor, you will face unpredictable and terrifying consequences, underlining the importance of your mission and observation and deduction skills. 'Doll Impostor' focuses not only on superficial horror but also deeply explores psychological terror, testing the player's ability to remain calm under pressure and make crucial decisions with limited information.

As wars rage across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, it is the age of gunpowder and mercenaries - that changed the course of history. You can do it as well, going from a leader of men to the ruler of an empire in this unique mix of RTS and grand strategy.","Renaissance was an era of science, arts, philosophy - and the art of war. Split between warring kingdoms, merchants, and religions, the Renaissance saw the rise of mercenary armies, waging war across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East for the highest bidder, with captains of these forces making or breaking nations. Renaissance Kingdom Wars puts you in the well-trodden shoes of one such captain. Youâ€™ll wage wars for your king, fighting real-time battles to conquer cities for the crown. Then youâ€™ll bring them to prosperity, becoming a lord in your own right. Once you master this grand strategy, you may already be sick and tired of bending the knee for scraps from the royal table. What then? Raise the standard of rebellion and take the crown. And if thatâ€™s not enough? The rest of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East awaits to be united under the leadership of a new emperor, who would eclipse the achievements of Romeâ€¦ You start the grand campaign as a captain of your mercenary company. Whether it is the frigid Scandinavia, the scorched Holy Land, or somewhere in between, your contract to your liege will lead you to numerous battles under their flag. From epic clashes involving thousands of men, horses, and machines, to brutal sieges and merciless naval engagements, youâ€™ll be expected to lead your troops to victory - and keep them in fighting shape once the slaughter is done. You may be rewarded with a city of your own, becoming a lord, expected to keep the economy running, engage in diplomacy, and carve out a domain of your own. If your ambitions are greater? Nothing stops you from tearing up the contract and turning your pikes, arquebuses, and everything else on your former employer. Still not enough? You can become the emperor general of the known world, stretching from the Pillars of Hercules to Jerusalem, and face the great politics that have already ended one such empire. Will you fare better? To reflect the dynamic nature of the Renaissance, itâ€™s not just the scope that changes. As you battle, siege, manage, negotiate, and conquer, the technology marches on. Spears give way to pikes, trebuchets to cannons, knights to cavalrymen, and gunpowder transforms the battlefield from a medieval abattoir into an even bloodier horror. All amidst the endless war over power, religion, and ego that tore apart Europe in the 16th century. From the sultanates of North Africa to the remnants of Byzantium, the Russian steppes and the Golden Horde, to the kingdoms of the West and the fractious Holy Roman Empire, there is only war - and over 500 provinces to battle across, besiege, and conquer for your sovereign - or yourself. Whether leading armies to bloody victories, building a domain of your own, or expanding your empire through violence, diplomacy and trade, you can choose to view and manage everything from the world map - or command from the frontlines, zooming in to witness the turbulent 16th century in all its gory glory. Donâ€™t want to bother with guts? Start your conquest as a minor lord from the get go, rather than carve it out with pike and shot. Or pick one of the thirty six historic kingdoms and engage in great games and politics from the start - but remember, then you are the king the other mercenaries work for and they might decide that their heads are a better fit for the crown!","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Portuguese - Portugal, Simplified Chinese",7.0,"Action, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","Single-player, Multi-player, PvP, Online PvP, Co-op, Online Co-op, Steam Achievements, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,9.0,0.0,76,62.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

Will you be led by lust and seduce every woman you meet, or will you win over and pursue that one special woman?","In Mothers and Daughters, you play as Maxâ€”an 18-year-old college freshman venturing into adult life. All the mothers are true MILF's, as in they are all mothers, and they are all love interests in the game. You can chase that hot MILF neighbor, sexy teacher, your best friend's mom, your arch nemesis' mom, or any of the other mothers in the game. (Pictured Maria and Teri) Similarly, all the daughters you meet are love interests, and you can chase any of them, from the shy girl, the loud mouth, your old babysitter, your best friend's sister, your arch nemesis' sister, or any of the other daughters who are either the same age or slightly older than Max. (Pictured Kimberley your best friend's sister, and Patricia your arch nemesis' sister) At the start of the game, you can choose the name, either staying with Max or customizing it to something else. This is also when you'll set the difficulty of the game. The difficulty setting doesnâ€™t change the content you see in the game, just your journey. The difficulty choice is designed to give the player a challenge or an easier path through the story. The complexities of pursuing multiple women will be more demanding in Hard mode than in Easy mode. In Easy mode, characters are more forgiving and have lower thresholds for Affinity and Persona. Where there is a scene selection, youâ€™ll get to play more scenes in Easy mode. For instance, on the second playable day at the mall, you have multiple choices of which girls to interact with. On Easy mode, you can select all the options. On Hard mode, you need to be more selective, as while you get the same choices, you can choose only a certain number. The Easy mode also allows the enabling of the in-game walkthrough hints. These hints appear under the various choices and show how they will alter the character statistics. These hints are not available in Normal and Hard modes. The difficulty mode also affects some of the apps on the smartphone. With the Easy mode revealing more information than Normal or Hard. There are fourteen mothers you can romance in the game. Amanda, Barbara, Cynthia, Jacquelyn, Jennifer, Katia, Lauren, Margaret, Maria, Meghan, Talia, Teri, Victoria, and Zoe. Each has their own personality, desires, and differing relationships with their daughters. How you approach their daughters could affect their receptiveness to your charms. If you love mature women, there is plenty to choose from. (pictured Maria) Maria, the hot MILF neighbor with two daughters. Chasing either of her daughters can remind her of what it was like to be young and open opportunities to fulfill her new yearning for intimacy. Victoria, another MILF neighbor. She lived alone until her daughter recently moved back home. Can you rekindle her desires and show her what she's been missing? Teri, the MILF owner of the local Cafe and mother of one of your babysitters (Samantha). Teri doesn't like to admit her age and loves the attention of younger men, regardless of what her daughter or anyone else thinks. And so much more. Each woman has her own desires and passions to fulfill. There are fifteen daughters you can romance in the game. They are split up into two categories. The younger daughter includes Alison, Amy, Caprice, Haylee, Josie, Keira, Kirsten, and Natasha. The older daughters include Catherine, Elena, Karla, Kimberley, Melanie, Patricia, and Samantha. The younger daughters are the same age as Max and attend the same college. Which classes you pick will determine which girls you will see more of. The girls are venturing into adult life like Max, and each has their own expectations. The girls in this group will be more suspicious of you flirting with their mothers. (Pictured Caprice) The older daughters are in the 21-25 age range, with Catherine being the oldest of the group. The girls in this group have already ventured into adult life and have a little more street smarts than their younger counterparts. They are likely to have more responsibilities and life issues and will generally be less suspicious of your flirting with their mothers. (Pictured Catherine) Not all the mother-daughter relationships are revealed straight away. This is designed as a challenge as the characters observe the player and may change their behavior depending on how they see you interacting with other women. Focus on one love interest and maximize your playtime with her. Aim for all her scenes and explore her needs and desires and delve into her backstory as you aim to seduce your one true love. Mothers and Daughters allows you to pursue just the one love interest if this is how you prefer to play. Youâ€™ll still have scenes with other characters and will play through other story aspects of the game, but you can do so while remaining faithful to your true love. Why settle for one woman when you can have multiple. Chase several love interests simultaneously and explore the desires of many characters as you choose the ones you want to be with. Mothers and Daughters presents opportunities where you can pursue multiple love interests. Your chosen difficulty setting can make this a real challenge. But be careful who you go after, as women will talk, and you could end up in big trouble. Not content with chasing multiple women separately? Then go for the group option. The harem play style is similar to dating various love interests. But instead of keeping each love interest unaware of the other women you are pursuing, the goal is to get those women into a group where theyâ€™re happy to share you with other women and even participate in group sessions. Unlike the multiple women play style, the harem play-through will present options to get a group of women together. Due to the pre-rendered nature of a visual novel, the groupings of women shown for a particular harem will be offered based on community feedback and interests, as well as story needs, as the development continues. First, youâ€™ll need to pursue women separately to get them interested in you. Then through game events, you introduce them to aspects of group dating and sexual interests. Some women will be keener than others to explore group sexual activities with other women. You can use this aspect to maintain smaller groups if you prefer, rather than going for one large group. Your choices, big and small, add depth to your adventure. Mothers and Daughters offers a dynamic storytelling experience where every decision you make, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has its own ripple effect. When Catherine removes her heels, do you say she's shorter than you or that you're taller than her? If she doesn't like being called short, she may bring it up in future conversations to poke fun at you in return. Those smaller choices are designed to make the characters feel alive and more immersive. Also allowing for subtle changes if you replay the game opting for different paths. Not only that but some subtle choices open other scenes. When you first meet Catherine, and she asks for help moving boxes, you can say she looks sweaty. In response, she'll say she will jump in the shower later. Whilst it may seem inconsequential, it opens the chance of spying on her getting changed later that day.

This is Kunyu Technology, a group of middle-aged men and gentlemen born in the 1990s and 1980s who have little love experience and have not much hair. They are so tired of playing games and really want to have a sweet relationship. With this idea in mind, we have launched a side quest called 'Together with our current friends, give benefits to the player master'. 'Let's create a real-life dating game that makes people's hearts flutter together!' This was a simple idea that brought together three teams with expertise in different fields: Yiran Films, Juhuo Culture, and Kunyu Technology. Yiran Films, the initiator of this collision, provided the original creative seed and is responsible for the visual presentation of the game. Despite being a well-established film company, Yiran has a strong internal gaming gene â€“ a veteran otaku director, a producer with a game major in college, and a producer who enthusiastically explores various games. This creative endeavor finally allows these 'misguided' filmmakers to return to the right path and release their long-held passion! Juhuo Culture is responsible for character design and story writing. After years of deep involvement in traditional film and television, they eagerly anticipated the opportunity to dance closely with the gaming industry, and fortunately, 'The Heartbeat of Them' came along. With absolute sincerity, Juhuo participated in the content creation of the game, believing that the desire for good content shines brightly across any medium. They also hope that the emotional resonance from Juhuo can resonate with users. Our team is 'complicated,' with straight men, straight women, and sexual minorities. However, our confusion about love is surprisingly similar. We talk about the wonderful experiences of love like a virus - chaotic, sweet, impactful, yet filled with the bitterness of regret. No one can explain or even understand the confusion itself. In the end, we chose to capture the beautiful side of love, gathering those heart-pounding moments. When you open it, you can be a blank canvas or silently recite a name in your heart (we won't stop you from reciting a hundred names), then embark on a journey. If you can immerse yourself in it, it would be our great honor. If you're facing challenges in real-life relationships, we hope this game can briefly rekindle your courage in love. Consider this a 'love letter' dedicated to love itself. We write it for those falling in love or peering from the shore, for those throwing stones at themselves in love, for those unable to send letters, and for those not receiving replies. Remember, love allows us to imagine beyond destiny.

This is Alone in the Dark as you've never seen it - a skillfully-woven narrative of Southern Gothic elegance and eldritch madness that pays homage to its legendary origins while taking the next step forward in survival horror storytelling. A Haunting Tale of Mystery and Madness Step inside Derceto Manor, an asylum shrouded in intrigue, guarding a terrible secret.

This re-envisioned classic invites you to explore an unforgettable single player adventure rich with suspense, frights, and revelations that will test the limits of your imagination. Featuring Hollywood Talent Experience some of the greatest acting survival horror has ever seen through the performances of award-winning actors Jodie Comer (Killing Eve, Free Guy) and David Harbour (Stranger Things, Black Widow) in their first videogame roles. Jodie and Davidâ€™s immaculately captured likenesses breathe life into Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, lending a deeply personal aspect to Alone in the Darkâ€™s story that demands it be played twice to get the full experience.

A Story That Challenges Reality Envisioned by Mikael Hedberg, acclaimed writer behind modern horror classics â€œSOMAâ€ and â€œAmnesiaâ€, Alone in the Darkâ€™s intricate web of mystery delves into themes of trauma, faith, evil, and abandonment. Whether you choose to brave the nightmare as Emily or Edward, you will uncover secrets that defy everything you thought about videogame storytelling. Explore Derceto Manor in this reimagination of Alone in the Dark, a love letter to the 90â€™s cult classic horror game. Return to the roots of psychological horror and experience an atmospheric journey worthy of the game that started the genre. Dive into a world full of sounds that make your skin crawl with a haunting, yet mesmerizing doom jazz soundtrack.

Most weapons are in the same specs for each classification today, making most modern combat asymmetrical.","Direct Contact embodies the essence of authentic warfare, delivering a first-person tactical realism experience that immerses players in the heart of modern combat. Most weapons adhere to real-world specifications within their respective classifications, creating a dynamic and asymmetrical battlefield. In this team-based game, players engage as part of Special Forces units from across the globe. The enemy forces are cunning and coordinated, actively communicating and executing flanking maneuvers to eliminate their targets. The game's focus spans a wide spectrum of military tactics, encompassing intense close-quarters combat scenarios, meticulous consideration of room geometry and layout, diverse entry methods, and the strategic intricacies of mid to long-range engagements. Hey, Warriors and Warfighters! To learn how to play the game, please head to our YouTube, where we have How-To videos. Mission Intensity The Missions of Direct Contact range in intensity. The players have to use everything in their arsenal to succeed. Weaponry Clothing Player Placement Tactics Breaching Charges Calculation and planning Direct Contact brings real-life actions into the gaming world. When a shot strikes a surface like a wall or a floor, the bullet can realistically ricochet back, posing a genuine threat to you as a player. Every bullet in the game adheres to real-life principles of velocity and drop, adding a layer of authenticity and challenge that mirrors the dynamics of live ammunition. Air Support In Direct Contact, our explosions are crafted with such precision that they approach photorealism. You'll have the thrilling opportunity to summon airstrikes from iconic aircraft like the Eurofighter, F18, A10 Warthog, and the Sukhoi Su-25. You can opt for laser-guided munitions or go for the added challenge of locating and calling in your airstrikes, all while enemies relentlessly hunt you down. When these formidable aircraft launch a missile, the process is incredibly lifelike. The jet's missile bay ejector efficiently releases the missile from its wing missile bay, adding to the overall authenticity of the game's aerial combat experience. Breach the Door In Direct Contact, the game design reflects the reality of navigating hostile territory, where doors aren't always readily accessible. Before approaching or breaching a door, vigilance is key. Players must maintain situational awareness, carefully scanning their surroundings and using peeking tactics to move safely and engage enemies opportunistically. Our doors are purposefully designed for functionality, allowing players to breach them as needed. You can peek through a partially opened door, swing it wide open for a bold entry, or even deliver a forceful kick to gain access, giving you dynamic options to engage your adversaries effectively. Highly Detailed Battle Fields Defeat your enemies on highly rich, detailed battlefields stretching over a large area. Interact With Your Enemy Direct Contact features a comprehensive system that assesses the behavior of enemy characters based on their in-game style. Players can engage with these enemies, applying pressure and encircling them strategically. This interaction triggers a fear system, which then influences the enemy's behavior. Their responses and actions will be shaped by the fear they experience, adding depth and realism to their in-game personalities and decision-making. Your tactics and approach will be crucial in determining how your enemies react and adapt during gameplay. Arrest the Enemy When an enemy surrenders in Direct Contact, you can detain them. It's important to note that you can't approach random civilians and detain them without cause. Civilian characters are programmed to respond intelligently, providing evidence to demonstrate their innocence if wrongfully accused. This level of detail ensures that the gameplay experience remains authentic and avoids unjust actions against innocent non-combatants. Weapons An object's hardness plays a critical role in determining the behavior of bullets in Direct Contact. Bullets can ricochet off hard surfaces, penetrate softer ones, or even change trajectories when encountering different materials. This realism extends to your character's experience, affecting their weapon handling significantly. In the event of injury, your character's performance will be compromised, and recovery takes time. When you're hit, you won't be able to bounce back immediately; instead, you'll require assistance from a teammate to receive healing and get back into action. Teamwork and strategy are paramount in navigating the challenges of the battlefield. Goal Our primary objective for the game is to deliver an immersive and intense tactical team-based gaming experience. From realistic sounds to meticulously crafted animations of our weapons, our goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible. We pay painstaking attention to detail, including the intricacies of bullet physics, to ensure a true-to-life experience. Moreover, we seek valuable insights from real veterans, drawing from their tactics and weapon-sound expertise. This commitment extends to every aspect of the game, from how weapons are handled to the visceral experience of firing them, all to offer players an authentic and engaging gameplay experience. QWERTY Direct Contact is currently optimized for QWERTY keyboards exclusively. Suppose you wish to rebind your keys or use a different keyboard layout. In that case, you may need to explore third-party software solutions for crucial rebinding or consider acquiring a QWERTY keyboard.

His mother died when he was very young and he never met his father, an elite special forces soldier.

Rockford's search will bring him closer to four beautiful women: a tenacious homicide detective with whom Rockford has a romantic past; a brilliant prosecutorial colleague and childhood friend; a steely ex-military combat instructor with her own notions about the justice system; and a sweethearted schoolteacher whose past and future will link up with Rockford's to change both their lives forever.",English,1.0,"Adventure, Indie, Early Access","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,26.0,0.0,87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

Through evolution you will be able to slowly become a more advanced organism which will have to deal with all the benefits and drawbacks of it: you will need more energy, more complex resources and you will have to manage more high level processes (eg. digestion, circulation) to survive: youâ€™ll become a fully fledged organism composed by many subsystems which must cooperate in a perfect balance. Each subsystem will have its own quirks and way to be managed, finally forcing you create synergies between all of them. In addition to this there will be external or internal interferences given by possible diseases: viruses, bacteria, wounds which must be healed and so on. Once the rule for this micro-world are set, the gameplay possibilities are endless! FEATURES Burn: energy is a crucial aspect of the game, you will be able to produce ATP, which can be considered energy stored in a battery, through glycolysis and even mitochondrial respiration! Energy will be used to power building both inside the cell and outside the cell. Evolve: evolution will let the player discover new elements of gameplay which will make the organism more complex but able to become larger and larger! Starting from circulation and leading to brain and neurons. There will be some utility evolution steps which will be used to give you better tools to optimize all the logistics. Grow: you start as a small organism and soon you will need to expand to make room for more structures and access better and novel resources in the outside broth. This will be done by expanding chunk by chunk wherever you want through production of the required scaffold and tissue materials! Supply: once the organism will be large enough, transporting things between building with microtubules wonâ€™t be enough. In addition thereâ€™s no way to directly transport materials outside cells so circulation will be fundamental. You will need pumps, arteries, veins and capillaries to supply or take away materials. Defend: viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. There are a lot of dangerous things outside! It will be necessary to defend against these threats by using your immune system to defeat them! Survive: a working organism requires some parameters to be stable in their correct ranges, this is called homeostasis. Temperature, oxygen, pH are all parameters that will need to be regulated to avoid perishing. Heal: what happens if the organism gets wounded? It will need to heal, possibly through hemostasis to stop bleeding, and then through regeneration of tissue. Breathe: most of the energy used by a living organism is produced by cellular respiration which requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. To breath in the former and breath out the latter you will need respiratory tissue connected to your circulary system. Digest: at the beginning of the game, simple resources will be necessary but later in the game you will need to digest complex resources (food) into basic elements, you will need teeth, stomach and intestine. You will also need to synthesize a lot of enzymes which are used in the whole process. Dispose: well, everything that is not used as a resource is useless and possibly toxic to an organism. Thatâ€™s why you will need a way to filter out toxins with kidneys, but also get rid of useless materials through other ways. Think: at some point the organism could want to automate management of the subsystems through finer regulations, thatâ€™s where neurons come into play: with sensors and logic you would be able to set specific rules which will make behavior of the organism automatic.

One day, everything fell apart, and the world turned into a massive pyramid. Various of creatures found homes on different 'layers', each based on how high or low they were. With no physical paths connecting these layers, we could only travel using huge 'portals'. The surviving humans live in the lowest, poorest areas of this new world. They call it the 'Tower of Shards' and hope to reach the top of the world one day, breaking free from an unfair destiny. While we won't give in to this strange fate, only a few people, known as 'the Marked', can safely travel through the 'portals'. They're our last hope. Endless Expeditions: Since humans are living in areas with few resources, it's up to 'the Marked' to start expeditions to bring back resources home. Unlock different characters, buildings, and items to equip your heroes and use their skills at the right time, making each journey unique. Base Building &amp; Gear Merge: With the resources you've collected, you can build and expand human homes in many fun ways. As supplies grow and new buildings pop up, humans can start to help 'the Marked' with all kinds of battle structures like buildings, gear, and other supplies. Expand your stronghold and merge equipment for stronger setups. Strategic Deck Building: With every new building in the stronghold, you'll unlock a bunch of fun, mysterious cards. The cards you use will change how you can support in battles. Always be ready to change up your cards based on what's happening in the expedition.

You assume the role of Stella, who was born on the ship 24 years ago and recently inherited her father's post as Chief of Security. Dive into the conspiracy behind the incident that threatens to disrupt the Zephyr's social order and foil its mission. Between Horizons is a modern 2.5D pixel art adventure that brings a branching narrative into a semi-open world. The team at DigiTales has applied numerous lessons from their first game Lacuna and proven solutions to detective game design problems to maximize player agency in the investigation process â€“ all the while maintaining the tight pacing of a meaningful story that will ask you to reevaluate your moral compass and make increasingly tough decisions as the situation aboard the ship spirals out of control. Features A New Kind of Experience: Between Horizons merges investigative-style gameplay with a branching sci-fi story in an ever-expanding Metroidvania-style environment. Solving Cases for Yourself: The flexible evidence system lets players assign clues to cases, confront ship denizens about them, and submit any case with evidence players have connected to it. Everything found on the ship is connected, but figuring out how â€” thatâ€™s the challenge. At What Cost?: Underneath the game's exciting and plausible sci-fi plot lies a number of thought-provoking problems inviting players to weigh intergenerational responsibility against personal freedom. Getting New Perspective: Timeless pixel art mixed with 3D environments and compelling visual effects come together in Between Horizons, creating a unique, beautiful art style. Failure is Very Much an Option: There are no second chances â€” submitting wrong solutions means the story will go on and players live with the consequences. A new and improved auto-save system will make sure there is no going back, as the story branches and endings are based on player decisions, none of which can be taken back. /","English, German, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Traditional Chinese",6.0,"Adventure, Indie","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,False

Yukikaze is an up-and-coming young Taimanin with a suite of deadly lightning powers, but when she embarks on a mission to rescue her missing mother, she just might have bitten off more than she can chew...","A classic visual novel about a demon-slaying ninja. CHARACTER Yukikaze Mizuki (Voice: Yuri Himuro) Our heroine, a young Taimanin who represents the next generation of anti-demon ninja warriors. She wields the deadly Lightning Arts that have been passed down to her through her family, as her deceased father did before herâ€”in fact, Yukikaze's lightning bolts are so powerful that she cannot control them on her own and must rely on a pair of special handguns as a focus. By generating bullets in their barrels, she can unleash devastating salvos of thunder that have earned her a nickname: the Lightning Taimanin. Yukikaze is full of pride and hates to lose, and opens her heart only to Tatsuro Akiyama, her childhood friend, with whom she regrets to admit she isn't yet in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. Due to her extremely active daily lifestyle, she remains suntanned all year round. â—† Ninja Arts: Lightning Bolt Bullets A powerful offensive application of the Lightning Arts. With a gun in each hand, she concentrates orbs of electricity before firing them at her opponents. Once in motion, these orbs partially transform into plasma, superheating whatever they hit and leaving gaping melted holes in their wake. Upon impact, their electric potential is unleashed, tearing targets apart with 5,000 volts of pain. Rinko Akiyama (Voice: Haruka Satou) Although the two attend the same school, Rinko is Yukikaze's senior as a Taimanin. The two are childhood friends who are as close as sisters, and Tatsuro is Rinko's little brother. Looking after her younger siblingsâ€”as she sees themâ€”is Rinko's primary hobby in life and she tends to spoil the pair, showing them a soft and gentle side of herself that no one outside the family ever sees. To the rest of the world, Rinko is a beautiful, strict, and elegant presence; she has rejected a shocking number of love confessions from the boys who want to get to know her better. Rinko is rarely seen away from Yukikaze, whom she wholeheartedly supports. As a Taimanin, her weapon is a long katana, which she wields in the Itto style passed down in her village. â—† Ninja Arts: Void Arts An atypical ninja superpower that allows the user to leap across space. Her scrying ability allows her to project her senses over a one-kilometer radius in order to see across walls and distances, while her warping power lets her teleport herself or other nearby individuals and itemsâ€”however, the latter half of her arsenal is temporarily exhausting to the user. STORY Near-future Japan is overrun with demons, creatures of darkness and corruption. By ancient unspoken agreement, humans and these dark beings have always held themselves apartâ€”until man's depravity began to break the barriers down. At present, humans and demons collude to form gangs and corporations. It is an era of chaos, but those who still choose to walk the righteous path find themselves far from powerless. The government has formed the Taimanin, a group of ninjas who, while human, possess the strength to fight such nefarious foes. Amid this endless battle against the forces of darknessâ€”and against the objections of Asagi, their leaderâ€”the young Taimanin Yukikaze and her senior agent Rinko volunteer for a perilous mission to rescue Yukikaze's missing mother...

Just by touching someone with his hand, he is able to cure all of their wounds in return for some of his memories.","Irotoridori No Sekai - The Colorful World is a Japanese-style visual novel produced by FAVORITE, a Japanese developer of romance visual novels. Story: Our story follows Kanoue Yuuma, an amnesiac boy with a special power, and Nikaidou Shinku, a translucent girl only visible to Yuuma who gave him that power. With it, he can heal any and all wounds. But it comes at the cost of the memories he's made. He lives a simple life: going to school and being scolded by his childhood friend, Kisaragi Mio, by day, and working with his master, Natsume Suzu, in the evenings. However, whenever he falls asleep, he always sees the same dream... a white world, feathers falling, and a girl calling out for him to save her. The student dormitory his master resides in has a special door in the basement, which connects their world to a myriad of different parallel ones. He travels from world to world, searching for one that resembles the scenery he sees in his dreams, but to no avail. Then, one night, as he's out at night strolling around town, he spots a girl jumping from the lighthouse. Yuuma rushes over and heals her using his power, but after coming to, the girl claims to know him and his power, and asks him much like the voice in his dreams: 'Please save me, Kanoue Yuuma.' Nikaidou Shinku: The translucent sorceress who gave Yuuma his special power. A calm, rational girl who rarely shows her emotions. She exudes an air of maturity in stark contrast to her youthful appearance. She currently sticks by Yuuma's side to achieve a certain goal--that is, to get him to experience love. 'Love. Romantic feelings. I want you to experience the one thing I was never able to.' Minami Kana: A strange, unknown girl who fell from the sky one night. After Yuuma managed to save her, she claimed to have known him and exchanged a certain 'promise' with him many years ago, which he has no recollection of. Eventually, she comes to live alongside him in the dormitory, taking it upon herself to perform the duties of a maid. While she's able to take care of household chores, her cooking is abysmal, and she seems to be gravely lacking in the common sense department. 'Please, help me, Mister Sorcerer. I'm really in quite the predicament right now!' Kisaragi Mio: Yuuma's childhood friend, who's in his class at school. Due to their longstanding friendship, teachers and other classmates often come to her for all matters concerning Yuuma, the habitual skipper, which slightly peeves her. She's noticed Yuuma getting chummy with a lot of girls who (she thinks) are cuter than her, which has secretly been a source of stress for her. Her cooking skills are excellent, as are her domestic skills in general. 'That's what I like about you. You're sincere.' Shikishima Kyou: A looney girl with an imaginative mind who never leaves her room in Arashiyama Hall and loves spouting off her delusions of grandeur. She has a very laid-back demeanor, and despite being a slight airhead, doesn't hold her punches when it comes to criticism. Due to being a social outcast who lives day in and day out playing and watching nothing but games and anime, she never sees the light of the sun, and accordingly, her skin is fair and white. Being a night owl, she always seems sleepy, but ever since meeting Yuuma, she's been leaving her room more and more. She also seems to possess a mysterious power... 'Are you my brother?' Toumine Tsukasa: A new resident at the dorm who always seems to be running to and fro, busy as a bee. She's a grade below Yuuma at school, and to pay for her tuition and living expenses, she works until late at night at the local bathhouse. She's honest to a fault and hard-working, but also very stubborn. Once something gets into her head, it can be hard to convince her otherwise. She also has a habit of tripping over nothing, although that isn't to say she's clumsy in general. She can handle household chores with ease and excels in particular at doing menial tasks.

Can you spot any unusual elements? It's a game where you find them and capture a photo with a camera. Two Modes There are two modes: Normal Mode and Nightmare Mode. In Normal Mode, an anomaly will always occur at each time. However, in Nightmare Mode, there are instances where no anomaly occurs. Is it that there are no anomaly, or is it simply that you haven't been discovered yet? For those who seek thrills, I recommend Nightmare Mode. Playtime and content size The expected playtime to clear the normal mode once is approximately 20 minutes to 1 hour and a half. It would take more than three hours to capture all anomalies. There will be a total of 81 anomalies occurring. Save Data Even if you stop the game midway, the anomalies you've captured are saved. However, please be aware that anomalies discovered using the radio (helping item) are not saved, so please be cautious. If the Game Crashes There are reports that updating the graphics card driver to the latest version resolves crashes. If the issue persists, insufficient graphics card memory could also be considered as one of the causes. Please try reducing the graphics quality from the settings menu. Gameplay Videos and Streaming Feel free to publish gameplay videos or stream the game without contacting the developer. For Those Prone to Motion Sickness in 3D Adjust the 'Head Bob' slider to 0 in the settings. This will eliminate screen shaking. Also, turning on 'Display Center Point' may have a positive effect. Recommended Graphics Settings Setting the Global Illumination to 'High' or higher enhances the game's atmosphere thanks to UE5's Lumen feature.

Original Soundtrack: Sumptuous, expansive soundtrack filled with epic moments (and a few earworms)! Why make this game? First and foremost, we try to make games that we ourselves want to play. As we get older. we don't always have a lot of free time in the day, and might only have 30 minutes here and there to game. So we wanted to create something that gets you into the action quick. No constant updates, long load times, or insane menu management. This game is for someone that wants strategy and intense action right away, coupled with a perk system to mix it up and a great storyline. What to expect: We are a small team of 3 people and it's taken us 5 years to make this game. While we are experienced and passionate developers in our own right, please don't expect AAA graphics. What you can expect though is some never before seen game mechanics and innovative systems. Because what TimeMelters may lack in cutting edge graphics, it makes up for with its unique design and captivating storytelling! Anyway, we hope you'll love TimeMelters as much as we do!

There is no room for error. Choose Your Weapon A true warrior is defined by their mastery of the blade. Your moveset is determined by your weapon rather than your choice of character.

Your journey begins on Earth... 3 billion years in the past, in the Archean eon. This is a challenging sandbox that can be played solo or with friends. It also happens to be a full scale Space Sim . ** Must have an NVIDIA RTX 2000+ series graphics card to play this game ** ** GTX, Intel or AMD graphics cards NOT SUPPORTED YET ** Current Features Engineering / build sandbox Resource gathering and crafting Solo or Multiplayer with dedicated servers Open World with full size Earth and Moon Space Sim with orbital mechanics Aerodynamics simulation In-game coding with the XenonCode language Workshop integration Creative and Adventure modes Fully ray-traced graphics Future Updates Survival mode Vehicle destruction and PVP Pressurization system Full scale solar system (with all the planets and moons) Weather system LOTS more content SDK for modders This game (and custom engine) is developed by a single programmer in a small team of two. Immersive Engineering Sandbox We offer a very advanced, high precision build and engineering system with small resizable blocks from 25 cm to 4 meters. In this game, you have to connect components with actual cables/pipes for power, data and fluids. Build in-game live in an immersive way, not in an editor. Code your own logic in virtual computers, using pure code or a node-based visual programming system. XenonCode We have developed a new programming language designed to be easy to learn and optimal for in-game virtual computers. The game has a built-in cooperative editor with syntax highlighting and multi-cursor support, as well as a node-based visual editor to facilitate scripting. Adventure Mode In this mode, you begin with nothing in your backpack. You have to gather resources and craft everything you need. You start by hand, picking up rocks, build mining rigs, build automated machines and so on. Some resources are underwater, some are at the highest mountain peaks. It's up to you to build vehicles that can get there. The ultimate goal is to reach the Moon. Native Ray-Tracing Our innovative renderer is fully ray-traced with a great performance. This is not a eye-candy, it's actually a necessary feature for this game to even exist, because of its dynamic nature. Since the content will be mostly user-created and it's set to be moddable out-of-the-box, we cannot afford any artist-driven baked lighting, and with the full scale aspects with customizable solar system, we need the sun(s) lighting to be completely dynamic based on the real-time scenario, instead of tweaking shadow maps and reflection probes manually like other games do. The entire scene is rendered in a single ray-tracing pass with many recursive light bounces. This allows for realistic hard shadows, perfectly reflective mirrors and physically correct refractions. Just make sure you have an NVIDIA RTX graphics card and you're good to go. The Archean Eon The game is set 3 billion years in the past. The Earth is rotating faster, making for 12-hour days instead of our familiar 24. The sun is a bit dimmer and the moon orbits a lot closer to earth and is geosynchronous. The continents are mostly grouped together on one side and there is a super volcano. There is also no oxygen, the atmosphere is mostly CO2, and it's quite hot on the surface. Life is barely starting to take place on Earth. Time The game takes a realistic approach to time, there is no time warp and no pause. This is because we have a focus on multiplayer and the planets are actually rotating and revolving around the sun. Two players would not be able to interact realistically with each other if their times were to run at different rates. Procedural Terrain Generation The entire surface of the Earth (and the moon) is procedurally generated, at full scale, down to 1mm precision. The world is quite empty at the moment though. Underwater Since the Earth's surface is mostly water, we have to handle underwater environments. Being fully ray-traced we can simulate refractions and reflections realistically. The game simulates buoyancy, so you can build boats and submarines. Space Sim The final goal of this game is to be a Full Scale Space Sim with the entire solar system. At the moment we have the Earth and the Moon, Orbital Mechanics and Re-Entry effects based on velocity. There is no artificial speed limit, so you can actually orbit realistically at 8 km/s. You can also dock with your friend's ship while in orbit, if you're good. We have great plans for this game, and we swear by our 5 commandments: 1. Thou shall obey physics It's NOT arcade-style and we do not underestimate our players. You must understand science or be willing to learn some physics. The game features realistic 6-dof space physics without any artificial speed limit. As far as we know, it's the only multiplayer space sim where you can dock with your friend's space station while in space at Full Orbital Velocity . This game is NOT meant to be a dogfight-style space shooter because that would not be practical with realistic physics. 2. Thou shall not see 'Loading...' Seamless transitions, no loading screens, EVER! From ground to orbit to another planet... it's all seamless. The game also happens to 'load' pretty much instantly... For reference, in our Quadcopter video, the recording started BEFORE the game's executable was launched. 3. Thou shall not hit a wall No fake boundaries. No skyboxes. No predefined paths. IT's a true Open World game, and it's all full scale. If you see a mountain, it's not a texture... You can just walk there and climb it if you have the courage... But I would just build a Rover or some kind of aircraft to get there faster. The moon that you see from the surface of Earth is the actual moon's terrain that you will land on, if you manage to build a good enough rocket, that is. The stars you see are individually rendered points in 3D space. It's not a skybox. But let's be honest you won't ever be able to reach another star. 4. Thou shall not be Thee Immersive, first person controls and no cutscenes. There will NEVER be a point where the player loses control of their avatar to a cutscene or to some long animation. This game will keep a focus on First Person Immersion. Even though there is a 3rd person view available, it's mostly for taking screenshots, the game is not meant to be played this way. 5: Thou shall make sense Everything has a realistic purpose based on science. Nothing should be fake, and in-game technologies must be at least plausible with some math behind it. This means that there is no such thing as magical artificial gravity. There are only two ways to have gravity in your spaceship when you're in space: Constant Acceleration: Players inside an accelerating ship do feel gravity realistically, and there is no artificial sublight speed limit as opposed to most (if not all) other multiplayer space sims. Centrifugal Forces: Yes you can also build a rotating station and you will have realistic 'gravity' sensation like you would expect. Also, there will be no Faster Than Light space travel. The math for a plausible Warp Drive would not allow that, but will let you multiply your acceleration quite a bit, in a way that you can travel up to 99% the speed of light.",English,1.0,"Indie, Simulation, Early Access","Single-player, Multi-player, Co-op, Online Co-op, Cross-Platform Multiplayer, Steam Workshop, Partial Controller Support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,92,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,True,False,False

CRAFTING What is crafting in Forest Ranger Simulator? It's creating useful things from literally whatever you can find. Sometimes you'll definitely feel like MacGyver. GATHERING In order to create something you first have to tear it down. Specifically, we need to acquire materials for building and crafting. To build a table we will need wood. In addition, in the forest we can find many other valuable things like mushrooms. LEARNING Forest Ranger Simulator is a game, however, we wanted to include as much valuable information from real life as possible in the game. Thanks to the notebook you will learn a lot about the work of a Forest Ranger, you will also find many interesting facts about forests, such as information about mushrooms. Learn by playing. The name simulator obliges. WORKSHOP Workbench. There's nothing like having everything at hand. Saw, pliers, hammer, paintbrush.... and many more tools ready to go. Why not build a bird feeder? DAY &amp; NIGHT The profession of Forest Ranger is not a job from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Here you have to be on guard day and night. Remember that the night is dark, and the only light is the glow of the moon and your flashlight. Watching the sunset or the beauty of the moon.... priceless. CLEANING Forests, it's not just trees, leaves and animals, it's a ton of trash left by people. You will find more than 150 different trash here. Sometimes you will be surprised what you can find in the forest. Remember that everything has to be sorted. You have special trash garbage cans for this. Some skills as well as large garbage bags will be helpful in cleaning up. EMERGENCIES A Forest Ranger has to be alert at all times. You need to observe what's going on in your forest and quickly intervene with a threat. Maybe it's a smoldering fire, or maybe poachers have set up snares again. Despite the fact that we were not able to raise enough money on Kickstarter, we worked hard so that nevertheless the mechanics and features presented even on the higher tiers could be included in the game.

Accurate sorting can be profitable as some of the trash is not really trash as you can sell it online for some bucks. Good forest ranger needs to take care of animals living in the woods. Give some food to hungry birds, build a bird feeder, and remove the traps left by poachers. Build bee yards in the forest, buy and build birdhouses, and repair hives.

You'll need to gather scarce resources and utilize your strategic and management skills to build a little train capable of overcoming attacks and fires.,"Get your tickets to ride the Trackline Express today! Small disclaimer: there might be some missing rails sections. And occasional barbarian attacks. But donâ€™t worry, our trains are the most reliable out there. Some just require a few upgrades here and there. Other than that, a perfectly fine ride is awaiting for you! Did we mention wildfires? Trackline Express is a train builder where you need to reach the stations while keeping your passenger safe from attacks and wildfires. Gather wood, rocks, ores, coal, and then transform them into various resources to create new buildings and equipment using blueprints that you unlock along the way. The game offers a unique blend of gameplay elements that could appeal to players who enjoy strategy and resource management and to those looking for a more relaxed and cozy gaming experience with occasional exciting twists. There aren't many resources in the desert, so youâ€™ll have to think about how to use them in the best possible way. Youâ€™ll need to collect enough coins to unlock blueprints in order to build anything. Once a blueprint is unlocked, itâ€™s freely available. Coins are rare around there, so use them wisely. With enough resources and the right blueprints, you can create multiple buildings and equipment to help you keep going forward and survive. What will you build first? A mine to get the coal for the train? Or maybe a well for your water tank? Unless you choose equipment to defend yourself against an upcoming threat... Each game is different and might require different prioritizations. Adaptation is key. Attacks are frequent. Youâ€™ll have to fight to protect your convoy. Fortunately there are a few items you can use. As more passengers arrive, youâ€™ll have to be more creative with how you use them. Feed your train with coal, build new wagons and new equipment to defend against, well, basically everything. Try to automate things to keep moving as the game gets harder and harder with time and distance. Bring your friends along for a ride! Join forces to tackle challenges on a journey to the final destination with Trackline Express multiplayer mode. Unite your strengths, strategically plan your next steps and defeat incoming threats! You just want to play during a short break? We got you covered! The game comes with a Daily Challenge mode. Every day, a new randomly generated map will be available for everyone, so you can challenge yourself and your friends! - high replayability value - many items to gather and craft - multiple game modes - online and local (LAN) multiplayer mode (experimental) - mini quests to complete - random deterministic map generator This game is still in active development.

The core game loop is that of a hectic top-down shooter, but melee and spellcaster builds are also viable. Note that movement is with the keyboard, since you need the mouse for aiming.

You could even share them in the Steam Workshop.

Scourge of War is the epitome of historical command simulations.","Welcome to Scourge of War. We hope you are ready for a fight. This game places you in command of the units of armies and allows you to refight the many historical bloody clashes during the age of regimental base warfare. This is a type of wargame that we call real time command simulation. Real time command simulation combat begins with Sidâ€”as in Sid Meier, who released the now legendary wargame Sid Meierâ€™s Gettysburg (SMG) in 1997. This game established a new genre, freeing players from the confines of the earlier wargame conventions of the hex grid and dice roll. It placed the units on a 3D battlefield and lets the player/commander move units around. There were no turnsâ€”combat happened in real time and could be interrupted only by putting the entire game on pause. It also included a multi-player (MP) feature that is still in use today. Then came Sid Meierâ€™s Antietam in 1998, an evolutionary release that introduced players to the deceptively rolling terrain outside of Sharpsburg and included other battles in the Antietam Campaign at South Mountain and Cramptonâ€™s Gap. The next step in the evolution of the genre was Breakaway Gamesâ€™ transfer of the game engine to the Napoleonic Wars with the release of Waterloo: Napoleonâ€™s Last Battle, in 2001. The final chapter for the Sid Meier engine was Austerlitz: Napoleonâ€™s Greatest Victory, released in 2002. A new chapter in black powder era combat simulation opened in 2005 with the release of Civil War: Bull Run by Mad Minute Games. This game is built on the traditions of the Sid Meier games but was an entirely new generation. It was noted for its highly capable Artificial Intelligence (AI) opponent and careful attention to historical detail. The second and final game from this very small company was Take Command: 2nd Manassas, appearing in 2006. This release also included the battles of Cedar Mountain and Chantilly, the bookends of the campaign. Both games received multiple awards reï¬‚ecting the historical accuracy and intensity of the real time command experience. Then came the start of the Scourge of War series. Recreating Gettysburg and Waterloo in the same fashion. It's been many years since those initial releases and old men need something to do in their twilight years. So, we figured we'd take our time and fix some issues, rebrand the game, get on Steam, upgrade the art, and see what we can do to improve performance. There are improvements to the graphics engine and a large number of next generation art assets. The AI has improvements that build on the experience from previous games. The AI is smarter, meaner, and more likely to run you oï¬€ the battlefield unless you are a skilled wargamer. This game now uses the Steam multi-Player features to allow you to match your skills against human opponents anywhere in the world the AI or both at once. So, make sure your guns are clean, your powder is dry, and get ready for battle on the legendary battlegrounds of history!","English, Italian, German, French",4.0,"Action, Indie, Simulation, Strategy","Single-player, Multi-player, PvP, Online PvP, LAN PvP, Co-op, Online Co-op, LAN Co-op, Steam Workshop, Includes level editor, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,25.0,0.0,92,60.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

It won't be easy, as the charm of the four girls may bewitch you. You'll have to contend with yourself and challenge your principles of justice and legality. Desire, sex, love... battling these emotions won't be easy. Will you fall in love with them? Deceive them? Be with or against them? The choice is yours! Features: 3500 Full HD Images 100 Full HD Animations 98,000 Words Multiple Choices Music &amp; Sound Effects Sex SFX 4 different endings based on player choices You Can Decide the Name Of the Character Ren'py Engine Main Characters: Emily Anderson - MC's Colleague Very serious and professional. Determined. Lacks a social life. Knowledgeable, talkative, controversial. She has made her work her life. Colleagues view her unfavorably, mocking her. Emily has no intention of having a relationship with anyone, especially not with MC. Can you change her mind? Imelda Thorne - Gang Leader Elder sister of Monique. Imelda is the widow of a wealthy and unscrupulous businessman. Strong and determined, with great wisdom and foresight. Cautious, making the best decisions for everyone. Patient and tolerant. She exudes self-assurance and remains composed even in the most dangerous situations. An expert at analyzing everythingâ€”situations, people, and decisions. She is the confidante of all the girls in the gang. Imelda seeks a man different from her late husbandâ€”one who allows her to be herself, shares her life, appreciates her for who she is, flaws and all. Someone present in her life who won't neglect her. Cordelia Ashford - Gang Hacker and Technology Expert Due to a severe emotional trauma, Cordelia struggles to speak, has communication and socialization issues, and fears everyone. She expresses herself only when immersed in her world of computers and technology. Cordelia is not just a computer expert but also a skilled martial arts instructor. Preferring the katana, she is adept at hand-to-hand combat as well. Cordelia is deeply connected to Imelda, owing her life to her. Her closed-off nature makes her enigmatic, especially regarding her romantic life. No one knows anything, and everyone is afraid to ask. Can you get her to open up to you? Monique Thorne - Actress and Camouflage Expert Younger sister of Imelda. Studied theater and acting, with minor roles in various TV series. Monique is the intellectual of the group, well-read with extensive travel experience. She doesn't trust people much, fearing they might deceive or betray her, much like she has done to others. Monique tends to be invasive in the lives of the other girls, protecting them. Winning Monique over will be very challenging, but if you succeed, you won't be disappointed! Amina Murati - Weapons, Explosives, and Warfare Tactics Expert The youngest in the group, Amina is skilled in both armed and unarmed combat. Daggers are her favorite weapons, but she is also an explosives expert. Amina worked as a mercenary in war zones, where she met Imelda. Despite her sweet and gentle nature, Amina is carefree and talkative, enjoying sharing anecdotes. Her strong personality and military background compel her to seek a strong and authoritative manâ€”someone worthy of her respect and esteem, someone who knows how to command and dominate her.","English, Italian, Spanish - Spain, Russian, Spanish - Latin America, French",6.0,"Action, Adventure, Casual, Indie","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

According to the theory of evolution, women are Godâ€™s creatures, and men are inferior animals evolved from male dogs in heat, so men are naturally inferior to noble women. No matter how smart a man is, when facing a woman he can only threw himself at her feet (and yield to the beauty of her skirt.) But is it really good to let your sexual desire rule you? I didnâ€™t want to give in to this unreasonable world, so I spent my life seeking to change my status. I finally succeeded in joining the world's number one company and a man's paradise, the Empress Group. But everything that happened during the training phase of the Empress Group went beyond my expectations, because the training was not about improving knowledge but strengthening sexuality. 'Trust me, I'll help you get through the training.' Fortunately, my direct supervisor helped me in this critical situationâ€”and she is a beautiful elf, how fortunate. However, it is up to me to seize the opportunity to change my status. In these seven days, I have witnessed many male colleagues degenerate into male dogs in heat, dating their beautiful bosses, but then there are the mysterious rebelsâ€¦ And all of this shows that the Empress Group is not as simple as it seems. Moreover, why has the world become like this? Anyway, from the moment I entered the Empress Group, I could not escape. In the end, will I become one of the employees, or will I give in to my sexual desire and become a male dog in heat, finally with my beautiful boss as a coupleâ€¦? â—†Gameplay There are multiple options in the main storyline, and each choice will affect the final ending.

History does not tell us that Norse clans had scribes of their own. Their folklore is said to have been preserved through oral traditions exclusively, but this is not the truth. Many written sagas were damaging to the reputation of royal families and expository to the church. So these writings, along with their authors, were aggressively purged from existence. Korvald was one such scribe. Korvald's is not a tale of heroism and justice, but of deceit and suffering provoked by powerful religious empires and unseen cosmic forces. His story begins as so many are ended. Family slain and taken from his now destroyed village, Korvald is branded as a heretic and seemingly condemned to death. The true purpose of his capture and torment are part of a much bigger and far more sinister agenda.

Combine unique abilities of your units. Expand territory and build mines to get resources. Find a balance between economy and army. Use spells to help your army. Relaxing, but challenging singleplayer campaign is available.","This game is a fantasy themed tower defense with automatically fighting tower-like units and a significant economics component. The units fight automatically, use their numerous abilities and decide which monster to attack. They are smart, you can rely on them. The success of the defense depends on the armyâ€™s formation and composition. If done right, an army would be able to counter any kind of enemy attack. The player can also help their army fight the toughest waves by casting spells, which can damage and weaken the enemy, or buff and heal the allied units. Spells can be purchased between the levels, as well as artifacts, that provide combat and economical bonuses. Enemies are not simply tough soldiers, they have different magical abilities, they use different tactics, they unite in formations of different units to combine their complementary strengths. There are more than 100 different units currently in the game, every one of which has a unique ability and fights differently. The army costs resources, and the player's responsibility is to build mines and farms to gather different resources randomly scattered around the map. Mines can only be built within the player's territory, but every mine built can push the borders wider, so some rare resources will have to be reached in a tricky way. Mines can be upgraded with resources to provide more income, so the player will have to think of the best ways to invest their resources to make more money. Resource management, strategic thinking and planning ahead will be required a lot in this game. But defending the castle is still the main priority. Enemies get stronger and stronger with every wave. Investing too much resources into economics might lead to a breach. The castle might survive the breach. The castle can be upgraded to gain more damage, fire rate, HP and improve some other magical properties, to help it to survive any unexpected breach. If all waves are successfully destroyed, the player gets the reward (resources and artifacts) and gains one more area under their control. Then they proceed to the global map, where they can improve the territories they control, to get more global map resources, which can be spent to research more units, purchase spells and artifacts, upgrade their units and open new builders. After everything is done on the global map, the player will pick the new area to attack and start the next battle.

You will then use the correctly equipped item such as an EMF Device to search and observe the evidence. â€¢ Energy: Observing evidence with the correct equipped item, causes Observed Energy to spawn that can be absorbed into your playerâ€™s body. This energy is what youâ€™ll turn in later to gain experience and level up. The more Energy you absorb the more danger youâ€™ll be in. Youâ€™ll want to be careful because youâ€™ll lose all absorbed energy if you die. â€¢ Story Not much is known about what happened to this world. What is â€œThe Darknessâ€?

Step into the world of Taskmaster, endeavour to complete a menagerie of challenging and extraordinary tasks and get creative in how you solve them. The premise of Taskmaster VR is simple - complete tasks and impress The Taskmaster. Sound easy? Well, it never, ever is. These tasks are taxing and The Taskmaster is not known for being lenient Mastering tasks requires skill, patience, precision and grace. And if all that fails, maybe just throwing things around and hoping for the best will work out! Just get it done within the time limit and use the plethora of ordinary and not-so-ordinary items at your disposal - Taskmaster VR features more stuff, gubbins and thingamajigs than you can shake a rubber duck at. There is no single solution to a task, and thinking outside of the box is encouraged - there are many ways to succeed and even more ways to fail. Either way, the outcome is always hilarious. You can use whatever comes to hand to do whatever you want, just donâ€™t blame us if you make a fool of yourself in the process. The Taskmaster House may look like a welcoming and unassuming British locale, but donâ€™t be fooled - this humble home is a colosseum of foolhardy pursuits and a theatre of broken dreams. The lab, the kitchen, the caravan, the garden - itâ€™s all here. Itâ€™s the quintessential British home subverted to become the ultimate playground. The Taskmaster himself, Greg Davies, and his long suffering assistant Little Alex Horne will have more than a few things to say about your efforts in a fully voice acted performance from the deadpan duo. Succeed at your tasks and you may conjure up a compliment, fail and you can expect (completely justified) withering scorn. Becoming the series champion is clearly the apex of human achievement - winners are rewarded with a tremendous trophy depicting The Taskmaster in a fetching shade of not-quite-gold! Winning isnâ€™t everything - your score reflects your individual journey, and even low scores contribute to your story, and your self expression! Completely fluffing a task will result in unique jokes and dialogue from Greg and Alex - youâ€™ll get to see things that the overachievers of this world never will. Your journey into the world of Taskmaster doesnâ€™t end when you lift that shiny golden bonce - Creative Mode lets you slip into Alex and Gregâ€™s shiny shoes and create your own tasks! Wielding hundreds of oddball objects and an arsenal of useful tools, you can get creative and let your inner Alex shine - perfect for challenging your friends in local play.","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Simplified Chinese",7.0,"Action, Casual, Indie, Simulation","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Tracked Controller Support, VR Only, Includes level editor, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,8.0,0.0,51,12.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,False

FEATURES A time-looping visual novel with 20+ hours of story Four branching heroine routes Japanese voice acting CHARACTERS Yune (CV: Mahiru Tsukishiro) Our protagonist Shuuâ€™s classmate, destined to become one of his closest associates. Sheâ€™s a vocal chameleon, skilled at mimicry and changing the tone of her voice. Kirie (CV: Beni Sakurada) A petite powerhouse who has been tearing through the school and town filming for a movie sheâ€™s making for the Christmas Culture Festival. Kotoha (CV: Beni Sakurada) A tidy, ladylike senior whoâ€™s tall and slender. Her oil painting skill is unparalleled, although she almost exclusively paints landscapes. Sakuya (CV: Usa Fujisaki) A reserved junior who always seems to walk one step behind like an old-timey servant would. She may look like a defenseless girl, but inside sheâ€™s anything but. Sister Lili (CV: Kohaku Sakurajosui) A teacher and nun at St. Aria Academy who in charge of its chapel. Perhaps because of her earnest nature, she is not good with any kind of off-color humor and blushes easily. Gidou (CV: Kaina Honma) A third year, Shuuâ€™s junior, and the head of the boysâ€™ dormitory at Palm Dorm. He is hard-working and dependable, but also â€œeccentric,â€ as all great artists are. Nothing he does is ever ordinary... and thatâ€™s putting it nicely. Youji (CV: Sekitoba) Yune and Kirieâ€™s fellow classmate and someone who becomes a good friend to Shuu. He usually ends up stuck with the hard jobs, but that somehow only makes him all the easier to get along with. Rinka (CV: Ren Sagami) Kotohaâ€™s best friend whoâ€™s already been taken by someone known as Bad Santa at the start of the game. Footage of that incident can only be seen in Kirieâ€™s film. Jack (CV: Kuwagatamaru Kinoshita) The owner of a general store in the townâ€™s shopping arcade that sells a little bit of anything and everything. He graduated from St. Aria Academy and is thus also Shuu and the gangâ€™s senior. Shuu (CV: -) The only person who comes from outside of the town. Heâ€™s got retrograde amnesia and while he knows he came from elsewhere, he remembers nothing else about the exterior world. SUMMARY 'A holy night with no dawn, my dear...' Shuu awakens, memoryless, in a town blanketed in snow that feels truly bizarre to him. In this town filled with Europeanized architecture enveloped and closed off by a humongous wall called the aurora, there is nothing more treasured than the arts. It is here in this mysterious town that Shuu is saved by its residents and allowed to live a fulfilling life with the students of St. Aria Academy. However, this blissful life is eventually taken away from him in the blink of an eye. On December 25th, an unexplained conflagration brings the town to almost complete destruction. Loving this town more than anyone, Yune decides to take destiny into her own hands and rewinds time back to December 2ndâ€”the first day of Advent. Why did all this destruction happen? Why is it that no matter what they do differently in the past, it all still leads to the same future? Why is it even possible to repeat these days in the first place? And what is this miraculous blessing, this â€œAmazing Grace' that is said to come on Christmas? The truth that awaits at the end of this endlessly-repeating loop will be written on this canvas of a town by their own hands.","English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",3.0,Adventure,"Single-player, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,0.0,0.0,94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

Each game start changes the cycle start time, altering driving patterns. Developed by a Hakodate Native The developer spent their childhood and student years in Hakodate.

The main adventure path can take about 4 hours for a single playthrough, but you can then replay it with different party compositions and besides the main adventure path, you can also try and defeat some of the powerful foes in additional scenarios in free encounter mode. Features A complex OGL-based rule system which makes for strong strategic gameplay 12 classes, from the Fighter to the Wizard to the Kineticist, each with different play patterns 110+ feats and 70+ spells to further customize your characters 20+ encounters in the main story-driven adventure path, and 10+ additional scenarios in free encounter mode Character level cap is 4. A story of childhood friends braving their first serious challenges in adventuring Support for custom maps, encounters and portraits Support for custom mods to add new ancestries, feats, rules and more Tactical combat Each turn, you get three actions to spend on moving, attacking, casting spells, taking combat maneuvers, drinking potions and defensive or other actions. You can preview the effects and success probability of all actions before you commit and weigh your options. All combat encounters are balanced, but many are difficult: To win the game reliably and consistently on hard difficulty, you will need to make use of almost all of your options. Every +1 matters: Buffing your allies, and demoralizing or flanking your enemies are often better options than making a third attack in a turn which would be affected by a very punishing multiple attack penalty anyway. A cinematic experience This game is a cinematic experience, where you fight one combat encounter after another, and these fights are interspersed only with (voiced!) cinematic cutscenes. The game doesn't waste your time: animations are lightning fast, cutscenes skippable, and you can really focus on the engaging combat experience. Or you can choose an easy difficulty, and enjoy the story of the Dawnsbury Four, young adventurers grappling with their first real challenges. Story of the Dawnsbury Four Ever since the Night of the Shooting Stars seven years ago, the small town of Dawnsbury has been beset by dangers. The nearby volcano hasn't ceased erupting, support for neighbouring towns has lessened and kobold brigands terrorize the countryside. What's more, the Golden Candelabra, an artifact that protected Dawnsbury for generation, has been lost that same night. But now new heroes may rise up: you play as the Dawnsbury Four, a group of childhood friends who have trained for years under the tutelage of the town mentor Roderick, and are now finally ready to embark on their first quest: to find and retrieve the Golden Candelabra and bring it back to Dawnsbury where it belongs. But even that may only usher in further dangers and provoke whatever sinister force is behind all these woes... Accurate to tabletop Dawnsbury Days uses the rules of PF2E, the second edition of a powerful tabletop OGL ruleset, and strives to remain as faithful to them as possible, so that the gameplay of Dawnsbury Days mirrors your experiences when playing with friends around the table. You play exclusively in turn-based mode on grid-based battlefields, and you can preview and review all dice rolls required to make attacks, saving throws or to deal damage. The game also tries to replicate the elusive 'feel' of a tabletop roleplaying game, with story, characters and encounter design all in service to that goal. Deep character customization You choose your characters' ancestry, heritage, background, class, subclass, ability scores, skills, feats, spells and items â€” and that's just at level one. On each level up (up to level 4, which is the level cap), you select from additional feats (and for spellcasters, spells) to further customize your character. There is a wide variety of weapons, armor and consumable items to complement your character. But you can also choose to skip all of that and use one of the eight pregen characters which are pre-built for each level, complete with items. Additional scenarios and modding support Besides the main adventure path, you can also fight additional scenarios with minimum story but with the same engaging gameplay. You can also download custom encounters created by modders for an additional challenge and variety. Some of these can be really difficult and unique! Dawnsbury Days is fully moddable. With code mods, you can add custom ancestries, feats, spells and even variant rules. Documentation on how to create custom mods, including example mods, is included with the game.",English,1.0,"Indie, RPG, Strategy","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Steam Workshop, Steam Cloud, Remote Play Together, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,35.0,0.0,98,127.0,4.0,117.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,True

Input the number of mistakes into the elevator, and when you reach the first floor, you will reach the goal. During the journey, bizarre and mysterious events will occur, but there's no need to worry. Even if you sustain injuries that would normally be fatal, it's okay! You'll find yourself waking up in Room 1028 before you know it. [------ Backstory ------] People vanish without a trace. In such cases, it's usually due to some intentional human action with criminal implications. However, there are incidents where no leads can be found no matter how much investigation is conducted, events so enigmatic they're labeled as 'mysterious disappearances.' Enter the Paranormal Investigations Consortium, known as 'PIC,' specializing in such supernatural phenomena investigations. Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel. Rumors spread online about guests staying in this room suddenly vanishing. Police started investigating due to the frequency of reports, but found nothing. The scene resembled someone vanishing in an instant, leaving behind belongings and half-eaten meals. Seemingly devoid of clues, we, with our specialized knowledge and experience in paranormal phenomena, can assert confidently: 'Every supernatural phenomenon has a trigger.' Detailed examination of the times and circumstances of the disappearances revealed a pattern. It coincided with a night wedding in the hotel's event hall, accompanied by the playing of Bach's famous 'Air on the G String.' Sending two investigators to stay under the same conditions in the room, we recorded startling events. One investigator, while asleep, vanished in an instant, leaving the other, who was awake, unaffected. Given that the room was originally a single occupancy, the lack of observers likely contributed to the mystery. Further investigation revealed anomalies occurring only under identical conditions to the disappearances: magnetic disturbances, slight decreases in gravity, and the like. Our primary task became analyzing these phenomena and developing technologies to handle them. One week after the investigator's disappearance, As we progressed in analyzing the phenomenon for rescue efforts, astonishingly, the missing investigator returned. When questioned about their whereabouts and return, they recounted: 'It was like the hotel but not the hotel, somewhere else entirely. Elevators and corridors, rooms that wouldn't open, and strange occurrences. You'd think you were dead until you woke up in Room 1028. Initially unsure what to do, I noticed a pattern. It began with altering the number of a specific object in the elevator to descend a floor. Descending with the wrong number, finally reaching the first floor, I was enveloped in a blinding light... and found myself outside.' [This incident marks its tenth year this year] For an occult enthusiast like me, this event left a profound impact. Subsequent analysis revealed the phenomenon's minimal danger. Those who went missing were typically found within two weeks at most. Today, Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel stands as a unique attraction. The hotel and PIC established a mutually beneficial relationship: the hotel providing full cooperation to PIC, while PIC ensures technological support and safety for the attraction. Though reservations were full for years, today is finally my turn. Heart pounding, thoughts entangled, body uncooperative, I still manage to prepare and leave home. My destination? Of course, Room 1028 of the Desper Hotel. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Finnish, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean",11.0,"Action, Casual, Indie, Early Access","Single-player, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,84,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

In battle, they put out fires, haul supplies, load and man cannons, and defend your ship from beasts and enemy sailors. Your crew is an assetâ€”so long as their morale is high. Positive events like well-fought victories, a good nightâ€™s rest, and delicious food and grog boost your crewâ€™s morale, whereas unpleasant situations like lost battles, shipmate deaths, sleep deprivation, and starvation hurt it. A resentful crew member is a problem: they might ignore your orders, throw destructive tantrums, lose all motivation to work, or even start a mutiny against you! Bombarding Action These waters are infested with danger, so do whatever it takes to defend your ship! Order your crew to construct and man the cannons and fire at anything that moves. Batter your enemies with grapeshot and hull-breaching artillery, and use harpoon guns to reel in and board enemy vessels for a proper swashbuckling battle. Clear out those scallywags by arming your crew with daggers, cutlasses, flintlock pistols, muskets, and bombs. Prepare for many deadly encounters on your journey. The high seas are filled with murderous pirates, skeleton crews, ghosts, rat men, packs of killer sharks, violent winds and storms, ravenous megalodons and more! The Ship Set sail in a vessel that tells the world what kind of captain you really are. There are variants of each ship and they all come with their own starter loadout. Caravels: Swift and well balanced, these ships are excellent at catching and boarding weaker vessels. Carracks : Big and made for war, theyâ€™re slower than most ships, and they often come with more cannons than men. Cogs: Sturdy and resilient with a fortified castle, theyâ€™re capable of taking a hit and returning the favor with their devastating mortars. Raiders: Originally built as trading vessels, these medium-sized ships are designed for speed and maneuverability. Arrange and decorate your shipâ€™s deck and floors just how you like them. A well-designed ship has strategically placed cannons, protected hammocks for sleeping, and stores of food and goods. Donâ€™t forget structures for crafting like a woodworking bench, tailoring bench, smithy, cartography table, and kitchen. All Hands On Deck! Make a memorable team of buccaneers by customizing your captain and crew! Experiment with fashionable hairstyles, mustaches, expressions, tattoos, hats, attire, and more.

Tang Xiaolan: Cannot help falling for her, yet her sorrow is only for the wind; All words become silent, who knows the fate of past life ties so tight. She comes from money once depressed, now fully recovered. As for the specific reason, of course thanks to 'you'. Lin Jia: So intelligent and romantic she is, to change the fate she steps into this. She is your matchmaker, poverty alleviation officer, the neighbor you grew up with, your tutor, your protector from the outside world, the family committee's designated punisher, the rejecter of your unwanted admirers, a stand-in for your mom, and your own sister of no same parents, simply put, your 'godfather'. Ye Shu: She was the lofty moon above the high ranges, the smile hidden on her face, freezes thousands of springs to come. The young boss, and a single mother. (I can't make this up anymore, there's a reason she's the final character to mention.) With the pictures presented, let's continue this nonse... or rather, to introduce this game. Essentially, for your first love, Zhou Yang, 'you' (the protagonist) struck a deal with the so-called god of entertainment, Xiubi, trading your future wealth for the ability of a superscout. Following this deal, Zhou Yang became a super star, and 'you' became penniless. Obviously, since 'you' traded your future wealth for the superscout ability, 'you' can't abuse this ability as a bug to make money without consequence. Each penny 'you' earn through this ability spells a hundredfold loss. Yet fret not about poverty, as the girls won't mind. After all, this is the logic of a romance drama, where money is nothing but a trivial prop. Speaking of which, 'intimacy' isn't the pivot of the storyline but serves for direct feedback on choices, then 'Public Distribute Affection' or 'Hand Out Clues' based on this value. The more significant value for influencing the storyline is 'Yuan'. Intimacy is the surface value, while Yuan is the core value. The logic behind this value design is akin to our first live-action interactive movie game, 'Underworld Island', where intimacy is the surface value, and obsessiveness is the core value. This time we made some progress, but overall, we're not entirely satisfied with the design of the value influence system. Our next project, 'The High-Tech Guide to Yao Hunt', promises further refinement, stepping forward with each endeavor. Product Character This product isn't exactly characteristic, but it does have a bit erotic character, hahahaha. The allure begins with the scouting gameplay. 'You' can wield your superscout ability to delve into others' potentials. If her star potential index meets the criteria, 'you' can choose to initiate a fortune-awakening ritual to help her 'activate her fortune'. As long as the rules are followed, her path to stardom shines bright. Everyone's fortune-awaken and fortune-operation are unique. Next up, the fantasy gameplay. Sometimes, being moved by a scene, fantasizing is inevitable. Successfully navigating a Quick Time Event (QTE) allows the 'fantasy' to roll on, though you're free to opt-out if it veers off your comfort zone. The third layer is interactive action gameplay. 'You' can engage in some interactive actions with them. (This part was not quite perfect and might be removed from the official content, instead released as an easter egg at the end of a chapter.) In the final chapter, the heart scout gameplay will be unlocked. 'You' can use the heart scout ability to discover secrets hidden within the girls' hearts that are related to you. The longer 'you' spend time with her and the higher the intimacy, the more secrets you can uncover. Everyone hides their secrets deep within their hearts, fearing of them being discovered by others, yet longing for the right one to unveil them. Waiting for the right 'you' to uncover the secrets hidden deep within the girls' hearts. About Us We are Mountain &amp; Sea Studio, dedicated to crafting live-action interactive movie games.

The year is 1905. Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other. A thaumaturge bears both a gift and a burden at the same time. This parallel holds true for Wiktor Szulski , the gameâ€™s titular protagonist, who is drawn back to the tumultuous streets of 20th-century Warsaw by family matters. The gift of thaumaturgy is intertwined with family legacy, passed down through one's ancestors. This mystical inheritance significantly shapes Wiktorâ€™s life journey tied around a pursuit of unearthly entities and their hosts. As only a thaumaturge can tame these ethereal entities - known to a select few as salutors - utilizing their mystical abilities to discover secrets hidden within the human soul and speak to the Darkness, no one understands quite like Wiktor how everyone suffers their own demons. Features: Shape your story â€“ as a full-fledged RPG, it allows you to alternate your choices and make you deal with the aftermath. Develop your character â€“ creating your own version of the thaumaturge will allow you to approach situations in different ways. Experience unique turn-based combat and defeat your foes using human attacks and skills as well as psychic strikes delivered by salutors.

Lead from the ramparts, push back the darkness, and hold fast against the creatures of the Mist.","Lead the last survivors in the aftermath of the Cataclismo as a corrupted world seeks to destroy all that remains of humanity. Build fortresses brick by brick, designing intricate, towering structures of wood and stone to fend off waves of Horrors as they attempt to overwhelm your band of survivors. Command powerful units in their stalwart defense, coordinating their varied capabilities as you race from breach to breach. Lead forays into the unknown to secure the vital resources needed to grow your military might and construction capabilities as you hold fast against the ever-growing onslaught â€“ siege after siege, night after night. Far from the relative safety of the Last City, your citadels and outposts hold back the hordes of Horrors before they can strike at the heart of humanity. Build impregnable fortresses across multiple biomes using an intricate building system that allows you to design your defenses with full freedom and strategic creativity, adapting your plans to the surrounding environment. Take advantage of natural chokepoints, height advantages, and local resources as you strategize for the challenge of each upcoming nightâ€™s attack. A highly modular building system allows you to design your fortresses exactly as you desire â€“ one piece at a time, with blueprints you have designed in advance, or using community creations shared by other players. Use your hard-earned resources to build structures that grant access to previously unreachable parts of the map, or construct fortifications that deny the Horrors access and provide your troops safe vantage points. Build cheaply and quickly using wood, or establish quarries and use durable stone to better withstand the onslaught. Keep an eye on structural integrity and load-bearing columns as falling pieces will kill friend and foe alike, often creating unique opportunities to crush numerous enemies with cleverly placed vulnerabilities. Adapt your fortress to growing needs as you acquire new tools and expand in an attempt to secure all the resources needed to sustain a powerful defensive force. Optimize the path from resource deposits to your warehouses with well placed structures and use rooftop construction to make the most of your limited space. Though the Horrors may test your defenses during the day, only at night do they pour forth in full force. Spend your days exploring the world and pursuing the growth of your fortress, but as the sun starts to set, you would be wise to position your forces in preparation for the nightâ€™s onslaught. Skillfully command soldiers ranging from sharp-eyed bowmen to explosive cannoneers to respond to an ever-evolving situation as new Horrors emerge. Draw the enemy into chokepoints lined with devastating traps and ambush them raining down fire arrows and pots of poison flung from your battlements. Maneuver your troops into precise tactical positions to take advantage of special traits and abilities made available as they upgrade, positioning them at heights that let them perform at their best â€“ a wise architect can design fortresses that allow for a tiered defense. Build vital structures to sustain your defenses against the growing threat and unlock higher levels of prosperity alongside new technologies. Resource gathering outposts, unit recruitment centers, and housing for your citizens all directly and indirectly support your troops in their efforts. Should the walls falter, even your citizens' homes can be used as a secondary layer of defense â€“ you must protect the citadel at all costs. Cataclismo contains all three of: an epic single-player narrative campaign; a skirmish mode featuring hand-crafted maps; and an endlessly replayable challenge mode that puts you to the test on procedurally generated maps where you fend off increasingly dangerous waves of Horrors. A complex map editor gives you the ability to design and share skirmish maps of your own to challenge the community while the intricate construction system will allow the architecturally inclined to build and share blueprints and help others in their defense against the Horrors. The Cataclismo left the world devastated. But all hope is not lost â€“ lead humanity through the darkness to a bright future as you design grand fortresses and command troops in real-time battles against a seemingly endless horde that will stop at nothing to see your people destroyed.","English, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, Polish",11.0,"Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Workshop, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",100000 - 200000,546.0,0.0,94,1918.0,133.0,1849.0,1814.0,1814.0,1814.0,1814.0,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False

As a contractor to private military organizations that stand to gain from the chaos of a war-torn country, you will engage in ruthless combat, discover dark secrets, and play to your advantage as the story unfolds. Setting Vietnam has fallen into a civil war. Gangs, militia and private military organizations churn the collapsed state to their own advantage, and require contractors to do their dirty work. Lies pollute the geopolitical state of Vietnam as factions churn the chaos for personal advantage. From 1950 to 1970, the Russian-backed People's Liberation Army successfully defended Vietnam against American forces. Vietnam rebuilds and prospers over the next few decades, especially through arms exports, thanks to significant Soviet support. However, the Soviet Union's collapse in 1990 leaves Vietnam vulnerable. Western economic infiltration and cultural transformation begins to shift Vietnam's geopolitical landscape. By 2013, China's interest in Vietnam intensified, resulting in the formation of a China backed Vietnam Communist Union Party. A front for a private military organization designed to sabotage Western influences. Over the next 2 years, covert and black-ops conflict between the US and China lead to Vietnam's societal collapse. International intervention started in 2015, but degraded over the next 3 years into conflict involving various PMCs and militias, driven more by profit and opportunism than by governmental allegiances, set against the backdrop of a once-prosperous country now engulfed in lawlessness and war. Gameplay Incursion Red River lets you play with up to three of your friends. Complete contracts and challenges from three different PMCs to increase your reputation and rewards. Access the vendor to purchase limited quantities of weapons and gear. Whether you prefer to be scoped from afar or like keeping things close and personal, you choose how you get the task done. Shoot and loot your way through the tropics of Vietnam to gain influence and wealth, or die trying and lose it all. Tactical and Immersive Incursion Red River provides the player with a balanced first-person experience that feels realistic, yet fun. Equipment and weapons influence ergonomics and combat playstyle, so you will need to pick your loadout carefully. Simulated ballistic systems affect weapons and have unique characteristics that can be adjusted with attachments. Bringing in the right gear, having a proper plan of attack, and emphasizing tactical plays will maximize the success rate for deployments. Weapon Customization You will have the ability to select and fully customize a wide variety of weapons. Swap out barrels, handguards, foregrips, stocks, sights or magazines and turn your trusty ak from a close-quarters menace, into a deadly accurate long range rifle. Player Hideout Your Hideout is where all preparations are made. Accept new Contracts, invite friends, or test your weapons at the firing range.

And then, thereâ€™s youâ€¦ the one who got super drunk with a bunch of whores, and woke up the next day at snoozefest, in the middle of fucking nowhere. Your goal now? Shake things up or die of boredom trying! This town is about to get turned upside down, so get ready for a world of BDSM, seduction and power play! Seduce those uptight prudes and teach them a thing or two about real fun. Itâ€™s not about hearts and flowers, itâ€™s about getting down and dirty. Every card in play must be evolved and learn special transformations to become stronger in battle. Every cute little lassie around must take it in every hole and become a strong, beautiful bitch in the process. There are four types of cards in the game: * Characters * Items * Residents * Combos The battle in this game is like nothing you have ever seen. The bitches... well, their name is legion. And thereâ€™ll be no shortage of very piquant and sexy stories on the way to every one of your conquests. Thatâ€™s how it is going to be, every time, with every new event in the game. In every district that you make yours. With every new trick you teach your cards. The game features a huge collection of cards. There are over 700 cards and new ones are introduced every month. Donâ€™t forget your girls arenâ€™t â€œjust cardsâ€! All of them have at least 5 secret combo strikes up their sleeve and unique personalities. Characters â€“ cards depicting girls of different occupations or types. They may be of five different rarities: common (gray), rare (green), epic (blue), legendary (red) or mythic (golden). During the battle, you can put together a Character card and an Item card for a more powerful combo. Items â€“ cards depicting all kinds of things. Just like Character cards, they may be of five different rarities. During the battle, they could be combined with Character cards to produce a combo. Residents â€“ cards depicting girls resident in a certain neighborhood. They have better health (HP) and unique skills. They are particularly useful as defensive cards, and their skills produce a strong effect on the outcome of the battle. Combos â€“ cards featuring the fusion of a Character girl with some Item. Combos are investigated in the Workshop and are key to winning in battle. Combos are much stronger than the sum total of the cards used to produce them. You will not find such an abundance of choice porn anywhere! So many that we lost count of them ourselves. There are Comic Books in every district and event. Each card has at least 5 porn transformations built into it. Many MYTHIC CARDS have their own comic book. And all of this wholesome goodness is tidied up into one awesome storyline that will literally blow you away! Enjoy our unique combat experience that features an extensive array of combinations. Itâ€™s not just that every card has its own quirks and favorite strikes. The cherry on the cake here is that all of those cards could form combos, and thatâ€™s what really matters. Every combo unlocks the girlâ€™s new porn transformation, which only makes her stronger. The game will have many combat leaders (avatars), each of them with their very own eccentricities. You will succeed by exploring the combos and crafting the best possible deck for every new situation you face. New Updates Every Week!

You want a bigger kingdom, more pleasant, with more rivers, and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury.

Intrepid adventurers will dodge scores of hidden traps, leap treacherous chasms, and flee relentless guardians through branching paths until one of the relics are claimed or the devices of death overwhelm them. Be warned, you only get one attempt at each temple and failure or settling for a lesser relic means you will never see that temple again... The cleverest players will use the phantom runs of failed attempts from other players to their advantage and avoid the missteps and mistakes that led to their doom. Once the legendary relic at the bottom of each temple is found, the temple goes away forever and becomes the priceless trophy of the skilled adventurer. Asynchronous Multiplayer Explore the perilous halls and colossal rooms of each temple alongside the phantoms of fallen players that came before you and use their successes and failures to your advantage to progress deeper than they ever could have hoped. Watch and learn from the mistakes of up to 20 phantoms including your Steam friends that have attempted the same temple and steal their whips as they fall. Unlock More Treacherous Floors Recover keys from chests to unlock deeper, deadlier sections of the temple that house more coveted relics. The more difficult a relic is to obtain, the greater the reward - the final Legendary Relic of a temple allows you to claim the whole temple so that it's gone forever. Blessings from the Gods As adventurers venture further into a temple, offerings of collected treasures can be made at altars to gain a new blessing for the rest of the run. Collect as much treasure as you can to please the gods and gain a double jump, glide jump, extended slide, damage protection, and more! Unlockable Whips Unlock new whips with success and choose from your collection before venturing into your next run. Each whips carries a minor blessing but also a curse that may complicate your attempt at riches and glory. Social Connections Players can share Temple Codes for their failed runs allowing friends to attempt the same temple or share their Adventure Code which yields a playlist of temples that a player has attempted in the past.","English, French, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese - Brazil, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",10.0,"Action, Adventure, Indie, Massively Multiplayer","Single-player, Multi-player, PvP, Online PvP, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",200000 - 500000,17.0,0.0,85,1626.0,251.0,1651.0,240.0,0.0,422.0,0.0,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,False

It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery. The story takes place during a violent invasion of Selaco, the underground facility that's home to the surviving refugees after the fall of Earth. You play as Dawn, an ACE Security Captain who, with her recent promotion and high level security clearances, is digging deep into the truth behind Selaco's murky history.

A dedicated writer has been brought on board to assist with creating an engaging and believable sci-fi story and world.

Our artists have created many different variations for each (voxel)object to ensure that the aftermath of each encounter is palpable. That once lavish office space now nothing but a pile of rubble with broken paintings, smashed tables, screen, chairs, smoke, and chunks of debris. Custom AI With our FEAR influence, writing proper AI was a goal from the get go. The enemy is fully aware of each other's presence and work together to take you down. They will keep their distance if you apply constant pressure on them, will rush you if you hide or run out of bullets, toss grenades if you use the same cover for too long, and much more.

With no one else in sight, he takes it upon himself to try and keep the evil infestation in check. Even since release there are over 5 worlds with 9 Areas of 100 Waves, each with 2 difficulty settings, so YES, â€œitâ€™s over 9000â€ waves with more to come in the near future. In the early stages of the game you will have two main currencies, Potatoes and Skulls, that you can use on over 30 upgrades that increase your stats or debuff the Potatoes, but donâ€™t worry, this is just the start of the adventure. The Potatoes somehow have various Items There is a set of Equipment in every Area so there are over 250 visually different items but due to the Item Rating, Enhancing Levels and Bonus chances, there are over 2M possibilities for unique Equipment in the game. But worry not. We know storage management is not something a lot of people like in general but the whole system is custom made and with autoâ€™s available to help you keep everything neat and tidy. The Farmer has a very particular set of skills Skills that he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for Potatoes. And each and every one of his many Talents, are made for the sole purpose of ridding the world of all Potatoes. Even the non-combatant ones if possible, as they make one hell of a meal. The Talent tree is huge, with choices that can change your play-style significantly. And the best part is that they are not permanent, so you can experiment to your heartâ€™s desire. And everythingâ€™s visible from the start: no fog of war type of tree, no hidden talents â€¦ or are there? Besides the Daily Quests, Achievements and Challenges There are many other features that you can play with, including a mini-game that you can play on a regular basis to get various timed buffs for your Farmer. The idea is simple: whack all the potatoes that pop their ugly heads out of the johns. Why, you ask? Because being a Farmer is a full-time job and enemies are everywhere! A feature thatâ€™s almost always present in all idle games The Reincarnation system which Farmer Against Potatoes Idle also has. But every time you Reincarnate for bigger permanent bonuses, you can also change between 6 different Classes, each with their own strong points and Talent Trees.

Only then can you ascend to godhood and become the new Pantokrator. Dominions 6 is a turn based 4x strategy game suitable for both play vs AI, player vs player. Team play vs AI or players also works great as everyone can do their turns at once. The game has a huge variety of units, spells, magic items and different nations to play. In Dominions you take control of a powerful being that rules a nation and aspires to godhood. The type of Pretender Gods can vary from magically powerful arch mages to huge titans or large monuments. The pretender gods have different strengths dependent on what kind of god you choose and what nation you play. When you start the game you decide what kind of god you are and how your Dominion affects your lands, followers and sacred soldiers. It is an expression of your divine might and the faith of your followers. If your dominion dies, so do you. Your dominion also inspires your sacred warriors and gives them powers derived from your dominion. In order to win and become the one true god you have to defeat your enemies one of three different ways: conquer their lands, extinguish their dominion or claim the Thrones of Ascension. Dominions is set in a fantasy world that draws inspiration from historical nations, cultures and myths. You will not encounter the elves of conventional fantasy in this game. Instead you might lead a nation of vanir from old norse myth. Aztecs, romans, israelites, greeks, kievian rus and lovecraftian horrors are just a few of the inspirational sources of the game. The first Dominions game was released in 2002 and was well received by strategy gamers. Since then Dominions has been much refined and Dominions series is still actively played making it one of the longest running 4x turn based strategy games. ---------- Dominions 6 is scaled up compared to Dominions 5 and armies are larger. We wanted to tweak the balance between conventional armies and magic. To accomplish this a couple of changes are introduced. Incomes and resources are increased, while mages are more expensive. Battlefield-wide spells are more difficult to cast and there are instead more mid-tier spells. There are some other changes with the same aim. The second and probably most influential change is the addition of a new magic path. No longer are illusions the domain of Air magic. Instead illusions, phantasms, dreams and the stuff of forgotten legends are manipulated with the path of Glamour. This has resulted in many new spells, items and sites being added to the game. A third massive change is the separation of mounts and riders. Riders and mounts now have separate stats and can be targeted individually. This change probably has less impact on gameplay than the previous one, but will still have an impact on cavalry and nations using mounted units. Dominions 6 features a number of new nations as well. The addition of the Glamour path has also affected several of the old nations.

This is rdein, creator of the Momodora series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, â€œMoonlit Farewellâ€. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of Momodora 3. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past gamesâ€™ mysteries and questions. Iâ€™m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, Iâ€™m designing â€œMoonlit Farewellâ€ to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of Momodora 1 to 3â€™s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, donâ€™t worry too much about â€œcatching upâ€!

Can you brave hunger, cold, and the undead in order to reach the Terminus and find salvation?","Terminus: Zombie Survivors is a turn-based survival roguelike that is set against the backdrop of a zombie apocalypse. Weeks have passed since the zombie virus took hold of humanity, and most of the population has already been infected. As one of the few survivors, you are still safely holed up in your house. When the power and water cut out, you must finally venture out to join up with the other survivors at the Terminus. Battle hunger, frigid temperatures, and zombies to make it to the safe zone and perhaps have a chance of survival! KEY FEATURES Randomly Generated Map - At the beginning of every run, an entire city is randomly generated, consisting of about 150 different places. The supplies you scavenge for and their locations are also randomly generated. This ensures no two games are ever the same, and your journey to the Terminus is just as challenging every time. Turn-Based Play - Every action you take deducts from your action points (AP). Strategic management of your AP while you move, search, and attack will be critically important to your survival. AP is restored at the beginning of each turn, but think carefully before you end your turn and give the zombies a chance to attack! Status Management - Keep an eye on your condition to stay in peak fighting shape. Youâ€™ll need to eat, sleep, and stay warm to perform optimally, and keep up your morale to have the courage to keep going. All of these things deteriorate after every turn, and finding ways to manage them is one of the gameâ€™s biggest challenges. Various Survivors - You wonâ€™t be given some generic survivor character. Each game begins with a character creator where you can name your character as well as select their occupation and trait. Make careful selections and allocate extra points to create the ultimate survivor. Various Places and Items - Youâ€™ll visit all kinds of locations, including police stations, grocery stores, and abandoned houses. These locations can contain hundreds of different items that will be important for your survival, like food, clothing, medicine, weapons, tools, and more. Fight Zombies - As you get closer to the Terminus, more and more zombies will stand in your way to prevent you from reaching your goal. At your disposal are a variety of weapons, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the parts you choose to attack. Day/Night and Weather - With each turn, one hour passes. Youâ€™ll need to manage your time efficiently because once the sun goes down and darkness sets in, danger lurks around every corner unseen. Youâ€™ll also need to contend with rain, snow, and temperature changes, all of which affect your characterâ€™s condition. NPCs - On your journey, you will sometimes come across other survivors in the form of NPCs. These characters might be willing to trade with you or accompany you to the Terminus but itâ€™s up to the player to either cooperate with these NPCs or threaten them and steal their supplies. Permadeath - If you are bitten by a zombie or succumb to the elements, thatâ€™s it for that character. Donâ€™t let this discourage you, because every death is a lesson. Use what you learn to get closer to the Terminus every time.

Seven magi, known as Masters, gather to compete over possession of the Holy Grail, which possesses the power to fulfill any of its bearer's wishes. They fight other Masters for supremacy by summoning Heroic Spirits, known as Servants, called upon by the Holy Grail. However, throughout the past four Holy Grail Wars, history has yet to see a single victor. During the Fourth Holy Grail War ten years ago, Shirou Emiya was saved from amidst the fires of war by the self-proclaimed mage Kiritsugu Emiya. The young Shirou started living with Kiritsugu and persistently asked for instruction in magecraft, much to the mage's disapproval. On the night prior to Kiritsugu's death, Shirou promised his adoptive father that he'll become a Hero of Justice. Fast forward to the present.

Sail through storms, fight and trade, capture other people's boats or build your own, extract resources from the bottom of the ocean, reveal the secrets of the Age of Water world. Water post-apocalypse The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive. True open world Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base. Hundreds of unique ships Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. Itâ€™s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board. Fierce naval battles Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck. You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements! Personal naval base This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources. Flexible balance between PvE and PvP At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers.

A gripping real-time campaign awaits you on a detailed 3d map where you can build your army and navy, construct military infrastructure, and fully command your armies on a regimental level. If you want even more action you can fully zoom-in and fight massive battles on a battalion level. Fight in real-time on the global map with regiments and naval squadrons. Move your General to gain tactical control of the situation in a minimal way. The presence of the General makes it possible to control the troops or ships directly on the map, actively use maneuvers, cut supply routes, utilize different types of terrain, and flank with cavalry. The battles can be fought with more detail and full tactical control by zooming-in further on the map. MASSIVE BATTLES If you choose to fight battles with full tactical control, the regiments become divided into smaller battalions allowing you the command of hundreds of units in real-time, creating a dazzling and realistic combat experience of the historical period. Troops are positioned in a landscape according to the placement they had on the map at the given time. Some will engage the enemy immediately, others can be re-positioned in deployment zones, while those which were further away may join later as reinforcements. DELAYED REPORTING Realistic reconnaissance is simulated, making messages the basis of military intelligence and battle maneuvering. Messages can be delayed or be intercepted by the enemy, resulting in your orders not reaching your troops in time or rendering communication with your distant territories impossible. BUILD YOUR ARMY AND FLEET You will need a strong army and navy to win the war. Form infantry regiments, cavalry squadrons, and fleets. Assign the best officers and equip units with the strongest weapons to increase their power. You will have to choose how best to manage your recruits - create new units or replenish casualties? Such decisions may have a huge impact on the course of war. MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE Lead your troops to victory. Develop regions that provide food, weapons, and ammunition for your army and navy. Build military structures to train special recruits or host your army during the harsh winter. Build infrastructure to raise supplies and plan supply routes that reach your armies while they are fighting. SUPPLY YOUR TROOPS Armies or Fleets cannot be maintained without an effective industrial base. Produce rifles, cannons, and build ships. A single shot needs powder and a bullet. War requires tons of powder and thousands of bullets. Organize and prioritize the production chain to fulfill your army's requirements. DEVELOP YOUR HEADQUARTERS Design the structure of the army in full detail, by creating and organizing army departments which are essential for a functional army. Manage their funds and allocate the right person for each department to directly influence the armyâ€™s efficiency in combat, intelligence and supply management. As the departmentâ€™s officers gain experience they become more effective not only in their main role but also in researching new weapons, tactics and inventing methods that will progressively further enhance your army.",English,1.0,"Simulation, Strategy, Early Access","Single-player, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,0.0,0.0,76,23.0,11.0,118.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

As Robin, youâ€™ll fight, hunt, craft, steal, and of course help the local people thrive to spite the Sheriff of Nottingham and his ruthless regime â€“ all within an open-world environment that can be freely explored. Robin Hood is a famous hero of medieval English folk tales, believed to have during that time roamed the forests of Sherwood with his band of loyal outlaw companions. In the game youâ€™re going to meet those legendary characters as well, such as Lady Marian, Little John, Friar Tuck, Allan-a-Dale, and Will Scarlet. Robin's main goal is to help a fledgling community of refugees and rebels advance and expand. Starting with what could be described as a small forest settlement, with a bit of care, hard work, and good luck, it can end up as a town full of people. Recruit local peasants, rebels on the run from the law, and even the citizens and guards of Nottingham themselves as your new outlaw settlers. You start your adventure with building a forest camp, which can soon be expanded following the arrival of new residents. You will be responsible for properly managing the space you secured for yourself within Sherwood Forest to build up the village. Another important part of taking care of the settlement will be to manage the community membersâ€™ professions and tasks, training them to become craftsmen, hunters, or guards, and to manage the settlementâ€™s resources, either gathering them yourself or stealing them from convoys and noble estates. As Robin's people grow large in number and strong in sword arm, an uprising in Nottingham may just become a reality, ending the Sheriff's tyranny once and for all.

Carefully plan production chains and satisfy various needs of your three-caste society while dealing with mountain hazards such as weather breakdowns and avalanches. Are you skilled enough to make your town thrive?,"Laysara: Summit Kingdom is a challenging city builder which tasks you with creating a new home for your people forced out of the lowlands. During a campaign or sandbox playthrough, you will establish multiple towns, each on a unique mountain with its own traits. All your towns co-exist in symbiosis, creating a trading network, which you can then adjust to your needs by revisiting already developed settlements. The Kingdom of Laysara has to be rebuilt! BUILD ON A MOUNTAIN Each mountain comes with a new set of challenges. Mounts differ in shapes, vegetation zone layouts, resource availability and weather conditions. Sometimes you will have plenty of room for farming in green lowlands, sometimes you will need to rely on breeding and extracting valuable minerals from regions dangerously close to peak glaciers. If you find yourself in dire need of a certain resource, you can always try to establish a trading route with another town. DEAL WITH AVALANCHES One of the ever-present dangers you will have to deal with are mighty avalanches. You canâ€™t stop them, but you can take precautions and be prepared. Afforest the key areas to create natural barriers, build artificial ones to redirect rushing masses of snow, or trigger the avalanche early, while itâ€™s still manageable. Create a deliberate and reliable strategy and you might even be able to use the power of snow to your advantage; fail to do so and find your city buried and devastated! CRAFT A TRANSPORT NETWORK So, transporting goods is easy, right? Well, not if your destination lies on the other side of the mountain, a few hundred meters higher, behind cliffs, ridges, canyons and rivers. You will need to create a vast, complex transport network consisting of roads, bridges and shafts to ensure reliable delivery chains. As demand for resources will grow alongside the townâ€™s population, always look for opportunities to optimise your transportation network, be it by building paved roads, using more advanced lifting constructions, or aiding your carriers with glamorous yaks. RAISE A SUMMIT TEMPLE If you manage to endure all mountain dangers, build a network of efficient production chains and satisfy all needs of your people, there is only one more thing to be done: conquering the mountain peak! To succeed in this great endeavour youâ€™ll need to reach the summit and establish safe routes for your carriers to bring in enormous amounts of building resources, but beware! Weather at this height is as deadly as ever. The final effect is well worth the effort though, as raising the summit temple is an act of total triumph of human courage (and your logistics skills!) over the elements. Final note: the game is a pure city building experience solely focused on the economy, resource management and surviving despite the inhospitable environment.

The male protagonist is a humble office worker, repeatedly oppressed in five years of working life, facing his boss's manipulations and colleagues' squeezes - a true reflection of what many of us experience daily. Fortunately, he meets six charming but different women, bringing endless color and joy to his otherwise dull life. We hope that if you're trapped in life and work, you will find some comfort and joy here. A Few Words from the Heart: Our team worked hard to polish a good story. The producers, directors, and scriptwriters argued daily over the plot to select the perfect heroines that cater to different players' aesthetic preferences from over 500 acting resumes. It turns out everyone has different tastes! To find a more authentic feeling of love, the game developers racked their brains to develop gameplay. Everything we do is to find 'that soft spot in your heart', regardless of whether the person beside you now is right or wrong, or whatever your circumstances may be.

FEATURES 1+ hours of story Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals SUMMARY It all happened after the grand adventure that was NUKITASHI ... The war is over, and Junnosuke Tachibana, savior of Seiran Island, spends his days with his buddies reminiscing over victories past. True coexistence has now been achieved, and peace will continue for years to comeâ€”or so he believes. One fateful day, a grave data-related incident results in him breaking through the speed of light, transporting Junnosuke and his friends to a parallel world. CHARACTERS Touka Reizeiin (Voice: Sakura Hanazawa) FS representative and student council president of Minotsuki Academy. A girl with perfect looks and charismaâ€”who leads her peers in the parallel world as well. Capable of overseeing everything from normal operations to strategic planning to direct combat and more, she is a major contender for Seiranâ€™s strongest islander. Outside of work, however, she is even clumsier and sloppier than Asaneâ€”and thatâ€™s putting it mildly. Although she and Junnosuke are incompatible with each other due to their history, he has no choice but to look out for her here as she can barely take care of herself. Rei Tadasugawa (Voice: Nanami Mizuno) De facto second-in-charge as president of Minotsuki Academyâ€™s disciplinary committee. Her skills range from miscellaneous duties to battlefield command, though as a dedicated worker, she ends up being pushed around by Touka in her daily life. She is a bit depressed when she comes to the parallel world, but her cheerful antics still win out. She is very close to Junnosuke and helps him in any way she can. Ikuko Onabuta (Voice: Aria Kurata) Commander of the First Squad, possessing the highest actual combat capability in Minotsuki Academyâ€™s FS. One of the strongest fighters in direct combat, sheâ€™s also a diehard battle fanatic who resents the existence of anyone stronger than she is, and has no qualms about making it known to anyone within shouting distance. Always a maverick, her arrival in the parallel world reveals a side to her that catches Junnosuke by surprise. Hinami Watarai (Voice: Shino Amekawa) An older girl with a huge heart. Put a folding chair in her hands and she can also dish out some mean DPS, more than earning her position as the teamâ€™s main attacker. Nanase Katagiri (Voice: Hitomi Yanagi) Junnosukeâ€™s legendary classmate. Filling a scouting role for the NLNS, she fights on the most dangerous of front lines armed with various nefarious spy items. Misaki Hotori (Voice: Nagi Koharu) Junnosukeâ€™s quieter classmate. Also a resident badass, riding all kinds of vehicles from bicycles to fighter jets. Still somehow operates under the impression that she is plain and utterly unremarkable. Asane Tachibana (Voice: Soramame.) Junnosukeâ€™s younger sister is a reclusive, foul-mouthed, and frequently difficult individual. She develops spy items and controls the Ariadne Protocol escape assistance program. However, she seems dissatisfied with her brotherâ€™s recent activities... Fumino Kotoyose (Voice: Poplar Sawano) A young woman believed to be the key to abolishing the old island order. She serves as a sniper for the group, keeping Junnosuke out of harmâ€™s way at a distance. Susuko (Voice: Natyu Aizawa) A junior member of the FS Fifth Division. Ever smiling and energetic, she is not afraid of alt-world Junnosuke, insisting that heâ€™s mentally still the same old insecure dweeb. She loves to have fun and is often seen acting on that with Junnosuke. That thing on her shoulder is her pet cockatoo. Schubert (Voice: Makoto Kaburagi) NO DATA... Rin Hanamaru (Voice: Haru Amachi) Hands down the biggest problem child of them all. Already ruthlessly ambitious, in the parallel world, sheâ€™s now a devotee of a certain local god and does as she pleases upon receiving a divine revelation. As the prideful â€œSHO Special Auditorâ€™s Aide,â€ she is obsessed with bringing down Touka and alt-world Junnosuke, though it doesnâ€™t usually go as planned.","English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",3.0,"Adventure, Casual","Single-player, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,386.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

However, two of them are tragically possessed by evil spirits. These possessed will slaughter their companions, and complete a malevolent ritual of a ghostly wedding.","'Sinister Night 2' draws heavy inspiration from the classic horror film 'The Thing' and traditional Chinese culture. This sequel masterfully blends the tense atmosphere of social deduction with the enigmatic allure of Chinese horror. In this haunting exploration of an ancient Chinese mansion, players assume the role of a streamer participating in what seems to be a conventional reality show, unaware that tragedy has already struck â€” two members have been possessed by the spirit of a bride from a ghost marriage. With the onset of the crimson nightmare and the revival of the ghost marriage ritual, fear and despair start to spread. Players must find offerings that can appease the restless spirits or expose the possessed among them to avoid the vengeful wrath of the wronged souls from the afterworld. Breaking the routine of Social Deduction Game Ditching the traditional role assignments of games like Werewolf, this game provides a more open-ended environment. The use of items, task completion, location information, and voting all serve as vital clues in solving the mystery. Players must adjust their strategy flexibly based on the situation at hand. Eerie Expedition in an Ancient Chinese Mansion This abandoned Chinese traditional architecture was once the site of a tragic ghost marriage ceremony where a family met an unfortunate fate. Now, a group of brave streamers ventures into this place only to find themselves seemingly transported back to that sinister night. Inside the mansion, red lanterns hang high, food still warm, and the spirits of those who perished in the tragedy seem to still wander within its walls. A Thrilling Slaughter Fest When the 'Crimson Dream' descends, a ghost marriage ritual fueled by resentment returns to the mortal realm. Possessed individuals transform into the bride of the marriage, bringing endless terror and revenge. As players struggle to survive, they must also collect clues and identify the true culprit to avoid becoming the next victim. Complex Strategic Gameplay Players have an array of tactics at their disposal, such as placing Zhong Kui statues to ward off evil, injecting adrenaline to speed up their escape, or using night vision goggles, crows, or compasses to uncover more clues. However, remember that the teammate who is overly enthusiastic and constantly waving an EMF detector might be the cunning mastermind in disguise.","Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese",2.0,"Action, Adventure, Casual, RPG, Strategy, Early Access","Multi-player, PvP, Online PvP, Co-op, Online Co-op, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,0.0,0.0,82,41.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,True,True,True,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False

Build fortresses and lay siege to enemy strongholds, gather warriors and board longboats, and engage in personal combat as you raid and conquer across England.","Sons of Valhalla combines side-scrolling combat with base-building strategy in a beautiful pixel-art Viking Age world. You play as Thorald Olavson, a warrior hell-bent on tracking down the Jarl who burned down his home, kidnapped his beloved, and fled to distant England. Raise a warband, establish strongholds, and personally lead your troops in a grand saga of vengeance. Across the North Sea, far from home, you must first establish a stronghold from which to begin your assault. Hunting your nemesis down will take resources, soldiers, and strategic thinking. Manage a growing economy, establish siege camps and training grounds, raise a massive host, and raid neighboring villages to bolster your resources and push your enemy back. Construct and upgrade a variety of buildings to collect resources, recruit warriors, and upgrade their capabilities and equipment. Elevate your burgeoning villages into powerful strongholds that provide well-armed troops and mighty siege engines. Establish defensive structures as you push further afield â€“ the enemy will not sit idly by in the face of your encroachment, and you can expect conquered border towns to turn into contested battlegrounds. Mercenaries such as pyromaniacs and skilled hunters exclusively available at these towns can turn the tide of battle. With limited resources, planning your expansions and upgrades is of the utmost importance to ensure you have the right soldiers available at any given time. Will you prioritize a larger army of low-tier units? Or will you seek out expensive champions to help forge your path? A sea of swordsmen will fall to enemy archers perched behind stone walls unless upgraded with shields, just as a lone shaman would be swarmed by enemy footmen if left without an escort. Lead your men in tactical combat by issuing orders and utilizing special abilities and formations. But remember â€“ a true warrior leads from the front, so be prepared to take up your sword to fight alongside your men. Recruit a wide array of troops to fight by your side â€“ from basic swordsmen and archers to unique champions such as combat blacksmiths and shieldmaidens, each comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. Success in battle comes from using the right troops for the right situation. Will you utilize the shaman for their healing powers to keep your troops fighting for longer, or is the rapid swinging of the berserker more your speed? Command your troops to overcome evolving situations on the battlefield â€“ order them to fall in line behind you, to charge forward, to retreat, or to form the impregnable shield wall when under a hail of arrows. Quick thinking, positioning, and army composition all play a major role in battle. Break through the enemy shield wall and cut them down with your own blade or become a master of the bow and spear as you destroy your enemy from a distance. Fling flasks of tar and fire, equip powerful runes to embolden your troops, and down flasks of mead to maintain your fortitude as you stand with your men, protect their retreats, and lead their assaults. After a hard battle, while your warriors recover their strength at your strongholds, you can choose to venture alone into the wilderness to find treasure and harry the enemy. Siege engines are needed to take down the mighty fortresses your enemy constructs as well as protect your own. Use catapults and battering rams to smash through gates and walls, and race to destroy the enemy trebuchets raining boulders down upon your forces. You are not alone in your war of vengeance. As you set England ablaze, Odin himself supports your cause with the gift of immortality, and with strength from beyond Midgard to aid you in combat â€“ against armies and their leaders. Acquire powerful runes as you engage in battle and place them on your belts to strengthen your troops, your economy, and even yourself. Unlock more powerful attacks, become a particularly proficient night-raider, or seek out synergies that maximize your warbandâ€™s composition at any given time. Will you focus on your melee troopsâ€™ health and stamina, your archersâ€™ ability to dodge and fight at night, or your siege enginesâ€™ damage and accuracy? Should you fall in battle, Odin will keep you alive to fulfill your destiny â€“ but at a cost. Runes must be sacrificed to continue your journey with each death, and your decision might force you to seek out new strategies as old favorites are weakened with lost runes. From time to time, you will find yourself engaged in single-combat â€“ a web of conspiracy takes you from one enemy leader to another, and only you have the strength to take them down. Balance upgrades to yourself against upgrades for your troops to ensure they are able to assist you in combat without sacrificing your own ability to overcome the enemy champions when faced with a duel â€“ especially against those that fight without honor. An alternate horde mode is available where you lead Thorald Olavson and his troops in wave-based combat that will put your Viking warriors to the test as massive armies clash under your command. Sons of Valhalla is the creation of two brothers with a passion for pixel art and the Viking Age. In-between the conquest and swordplay, we hope you will enjoy the little touches â€“ the look of the buildings, the ducks swimming on water, your canine companion, and the general atmosphere as days turn to nights, sunshine to storms.","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese - Brazil, Simplified Chinese, Czech, Hungarian, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian",17.0,"Action, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Trading Cards, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",0 - 20000,612.0,79.0,65,195.0,112.0,275.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,True,True

Here, everyone can find their path to power.","In Reign of Guilds, one doesn't need to survive, build cabins, or cultivate cabbage. Here, nobody values blisters from a pickaxe or a shovel, but what considered as value are interaction skills with other players, be it either combat or diplomacy, trade or craft. Some Guilds will go toe-to-toe in deadly battles for the lands, castles, titles, and the throne, while others will win over craft and trade markets without any bloodshed and position themselves on the same level with Counts and the King. The King, Counts, associations, the Royal Bank, taxes, commissions, expenditure on lands and maintenance of auctions? Let's get this sorted out. Dynamic combat system from the first person view with full non-target, enabled friendly fire, and a unique system of magical buffs. A new look at â€œoldâ€ rules and a minimal amount of restrictions. PvP and PvE only in the open-world. Loss of experience and drop of items when killed, depending on the karma of the character. The character development is possible via any of the three ways in any combinations: PvE / Craft / PvP. B2P monetization. Players from different countries will collide with each other within one Kingdom of Dwarrhan fighting for the throne, titles, and areas of influence. There are 7 Counties on each continent. In the center of Dwarrhan, there is a Royal County under the same title. Traveling over the kingdom is free, seamless, and is restricted only by the game mechanics. There are more than 60 castles of different levels on the Eastern and Western continents. Almost every Castle plays a role in capturing of power in the Counties. The Guildsâ€™ Heads can receive the title of Count. A Count gets the right to receive trading and land taxes from all the players on his territory, but he bears the expenses for maintenance of his possessions. The Counts will fight for the Royal Throne. The King not only rules over his County and the Royal trade, but he sets the Royal Tax for the Counts by taking some part of taxes collected by them. The economy is deeply embedded into all game aspects for each player via taxes, commissions, and expenses on development and maintenance of the lands and markets. Only a reasonable balance will lead to the prosperity of the County and the whole Kingdom. All the resources are available in the open-world and distributed unequally over the Counties and continents. The mining and processing of the resources are given in the hands of NPCs, but the Count must maintain the corresponding industries for that. All players have to do is to collect the resources and transport them to economically advantageous places for processing.. Under the condition of the open-world PvP, only organized groups will be able to ensure effective and secure transportation of the resources. Collected taxes of all levels must also be transported from the main castles to the branches of the Royal Bank. The multi-level craft system. Up to 27 thousand of variations of characteristics for a single item. The wear and tear gradually cause items to lose their characteristics. There are associations of Traders, Craftsmen, and Mercenaries in each County. Each Association has its own auction which is ruled by its Head Guild. Not only it sets the number of commissions, but also it is able to completely block the access to the auction by Guilds, Counts, and the King.

As towns grow they will need to cultivate their own crops and prospect for ores to keep your economy moving and your townspeople happily supplied with goods. Over time your town will grow bigger and bigger until you are managing a huge number of buildings, quests, recipes, research, and upgrades. With enough progress you'll be able to build additional towns in new biomes containing unique resources, and trade goods between them to maximize each region's specialties.

You just might fall in love, and thatâ€™s never good for a loner like Nyx. Vaygren, a fantastical world, filled with memorable women and nations constantly at warâ€¦ at least until Alees used her might and magic to unify the world. The great Queen Alees will do whatever necessary to keep her peace! Rebellion is on the rise! The renowned general Solara sends Nyx, an ambitious and proud Nekomata under her command, to investigate possible rebellious activities and eliminate them. Nyx graciously eagerly accepts the assignment, although sheâ€™s less than thrilled to find that her team for the mission consists solely of newbie cadets fresh out of training. Even so, her ambition wonâ€™t let her turn down the assignment. And besidesâ€¦ there are perks to being in command of an entire squad of hotties, and Nyx never could turn down a hot piece of tail. Nyx is the newly appointed command leader of a young group of cadets, and having been born a Nekomata, often considered a weaker species, has fought hard to convey to others she is more than capable to lead them. Although leading them on what should be a simple mission may prove more problematic than Nyx could predict. Yvain is stoic, calm, hardworking, and one of the very few dark elves left on Vaygren. All Yvainâ€™s hard work and beauty has definitely gained the attraction of the Queen. Will this attention go to her head and can she continue to focus on training and the mission? Or perhaps it will distract her and bring the rest of the squad down with her. Cassidy is brash, outgoing and reckless. She also just happens to be another very rare dark elf and exceptionally jealous of Yvain. Joining Nyxâ€™s squad gives her another opportunity to demonstrate her superiority over Yvain. Now if only she could keep her head on the mission rather than booze and lucky ladies. Raâ€™Ga is originally from Thalmia, but ran away from troubles at home to join the Army, despite the difficulties and discrimination against the non-Elf and non-Vaymen races in the Royal army. Sheâ€™s not thrilled about returning to her hometown on her newest assignment with Nyxâ€™s squad. Phylla is a caring and thoughtful newly graduated recruit in the army. Recently assigned to Nyxâ€™s squad for her first mission she plans on giving it the same care and consideration she does her cooking and training. She might have started her military training late, but excelled thanks to her knowledge of field medicine and, er, other assets. Rheen is known for her energy and enthusiasm, as well as her passion for justice and making the world a better place, something not often found in the army's usual recruits. She is quite excited to be assigned to Nyx's squad for her first mission. Wherever Rheen goes, her best friend, Snookums, is never far behind..

Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories. You can even sell them or eat them! Survival In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes. Mounts &amp; Exploration Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and skyâ€”allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world. Building Structures Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals. Production Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort. Farming Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead. Factories &amp; Automation Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fedâ€”until they're dead, that is. Dungeon Exploration With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your lifeâ€”even if it costs their own. Breeding &amp; Genetics Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents.

Rule your lands as a medieval lord – the seasons pass, the weather changes, and cities rise and fall.","Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest. Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable. Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed. Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth. Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly. Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes â€“ they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide. Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter. From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests. Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation. Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoplesâ€™ homes, import goods you canâ€™t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers. Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering. Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead? Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely â€“ a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well. Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city. This game is a passion project started by a solo developer .

Whether you go through the trials alone or in teams, if you survive long enough and complete the therapy, Murkoff will happily let you leaveâ€¦ but will you be the same? SYNOPSIS Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit. SURVIVE: SOLO OR COOP Youâ€™re all prisoners of Murkoff trapped inside their facility. You can choose to complete the trials by yourself or you can tackle them in a team of 2, 3, or 4 players. Coop is never forced when it comes to mandatory objectives but working together can be highly beneficial. Whatever the number of players in your party, itâ€™s about surviving and getting out. Ultimately, your goal is to complete Murkoff's therapy and earn the right to be released back into society. In order to do so, you must complete the Trials and the MK-Challenges. Trials are immersive story driven therapies that take a certain time to complete. Mk-Challenges are shorter therapies occurring in modified or redesigned section of an existing map. HIDE OR FLIGHT In pure Outlast fashion, the core gameplay involves avoiding enemies, hiding from them, and trying to run away. Murkoff will provide tools you can use to increase your stealth capabilities, create opportunities to flee, slow down enemies, and more. However, you will have to earn those tools and work hard to improve them. The tools will allow you to Stun enemies Blind them See through walls Heal yourself and people around you. Murkoff will ask you to perform disturbing tasks in each trials or mk-challenges. Only after completing those, will you be allowed to exit the Trials or the MK-Challenges. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Customize and create your own trial patient. Your cell is your home while you complete the therapy, you can decorate it however you wish. Choose your tools, upgrades, and perks to fit your playstyle. Meet the Denizens of Murkoffâ€™s Sinyala Facility in The Outlast Trials. Each one of them will try and help you get through the Trials in one piece! Think youâ€™ll make it? INVESTIGATE Youâ€™ve been abducted by the Murkoff Corporation to undergo unethical experiments that will modify your psyche and behavior throughout the Trials. Collect documents and items that will help prove Murkoffâ€™s malpractice against its patients. The Process: Break the Self: Murkoff aims to break down the test subjectâ€™s fundamental beliefs. Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down. Build the Self: Itâ€™s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement. This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity. Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology. This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground. Content and Photosensitivity Warning: The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.

As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable - including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importanceâ€¦ usually. After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect - known as The Order - is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.

Up to 6 players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry. Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the worldâ€™s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, thereâ€™s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isnâ€™t your forte, so youâ€™ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps - everything your big science brain can muster!

Manage the lives of your citizens from education to work and party loyalty to criminal activity.,"Manage all aspects of your own republic with planned economy, including mining resources, manufacturing goods, construction, investments, and citizens too. Create your own industrial complexes with loading and unloading stations, storage, warehouses, and factories. Build the infrastructure and manage its traffic , including roads, railways, sidewalks, conveyors, wiring, and pipelines. Wisely place and connect factories, houses and warehouses, and make the most efficient connections. Plan and build the living areas with everything your citizens may need to live their happy life, such as playgrounds, cinema s, taverns, and shops. Send your citizens to the mine to get coal, iron and other natural resources; or send them to the fields to pick up the crops; or take them to factories to produce manufactured goods. Sell and purchase resources and goods from western countries or other soviet countries to get dollars or rubles and buy the products or resources you need ... or invest in new infrastructure or buildings. Enjoy authentic soviet buildings and vehicles , as well as realistic landscapes of the 60's to the 90's. Play the way you want! You can focus on getting natural resources or products and trade them for money; or you can build a self-sufficient republic; or you can just use the easy sandbox mode with unlimited money/resources and just enjoy building something live. Economic simulation. Prices of resources on the global market are changing over time as you play â€“one day you can sell or purchase steel for a $100 per ton, but in a few months the cost can rise to $200 or decrease to $50. The price of everything is connected to the cost of work and resources. Increasing difficulty. As prices change, the demands of the citizens also change, and you will need more resources to keep them happy and force them to work. TRANSPORTATION You have many options for how you will manage resources and goods transportation. If you get raw iron ore from a mine, you need to process it. Then you need to transport it somehow into a steel mill to produce steel. You can build the processing plant and steel mill near to the mine and transport it all by conveyors, or you can transport iron ore into a steel mill by train fora longer distance. It is up to you to decide from where the workers will go into the factories. You can create residential zones and transport workers by buses or trains to industrial areas. You can also build residential buildings near the factories so that workers will able to walk to the factory. But don't forget that a worker will need to purchase food and enjoy their free time, so again it is up to you to decide whether to build those facilities near their home or whether you will transport them somehow to shops or places to spend their free time. RESOURCES &amp; INDUSTRY There are, right now, over 30 commodities you can mine, transport and manufacture. If you want to get clothes you will first need to get resources to create a fabric, then you will need a clothing factory where the clothes will be manufactured from this fabric. You can then transport the finished clothes into shops where your citizens can buy them. Every commodity has a specific requirement,so if you would like to load oil into the tank train-car you will need a special pumping loading station. If you need to load gravel into a dumper truck you need a special loading station where the gravel comes from conveyors into the truck. Liquid resources like oil or fuel can be stored only in tanks, while resources like wood, steel, or prefabricated concrete panels can be stored outside in the open space. Using a crane for these will increase loading/unloading speed. Goods like clothes, food, etc. can be stored in warehouses. WORKERS AND THEIRS DEMANDS Every worker/citizen goes to work each day. If they work for you, they have demands. At the start of the game they are satisfied just with food, but as a time goes on they may have more demands like meat, clothes, alcohol or electronics. Also, to have happy workers you need places where they can spend their leisure time â€“ cinema, playgrounds, taverns, etc. Every worker has an education level. They can go to school or college to improve this level. If their education is too low they cannot work; if their education is high enough they can be a teacher, or researcher, or work in factories with special requirements. ECONOMY SIMULATION The game simulates the economy system. There are no fixed prices! Costs of everything are defined by the economic situation. For example, the cost of steel is calculated from the price of iron, coal and work, and also partially from the cost of steel mill construction. You purchase or sell commodities for money (dollars or rubles). But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper. As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.","English, French, German, Polish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish - Spain, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese - Brazil, Hungarian, Korean, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Slovak",17.0,"Simulation, Strategy","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Steam Workshop, Partial Controller Support, Steam Cloud, Includes level editor, Family Sharing",200000 - 500000,1435.0,0.0,93,10272.0,1070.0,10806.0,6536.0,563.0,9269.0,563.0,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,True,True,True,False,True

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time.","/ UBOAT UBOAT is a simulator of a submarine from WWII era, yet different than all you have seen so far. It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, thereâ€™s no chance of winning even a skirmish. Survival The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Polish, Russian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Czech, Portuguese - Portugal, Japanese",13.0,"Action, Indie, RPG, Simulation, Strategy","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Steam Workshop, Steam Workshop, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing",200000 - 500000,516.0,0.0,82,10727.0,2576.0,12550.0,2336.0,37.0,1271.0,37.0,False,True,False,True,True,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,True,True,False,False
