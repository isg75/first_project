17i2fhi,Are you guys worried that AI will take your job?,k6rg2pa,usernames_suck_ok,39,"The fact that employers don't want people to work from home is a bigger threat than AI is. I could always easily get a job working in person, but that's not what I want. It's also not what a ton of other people want. The demand for remote jobs in my layoff-happy field is greater than the supply, and *that's* what concerns me. 

My job is the kind where many employers will post a job listing wanting someone to do 50 million totally different things/skill sets and then want to only pay $50,000-$70,000K or will want to pay differently according to where you live, as if it's not actually about finding someone who can do the job and paying them for *that*.

Capitalism will cease to function on any reasonable level where the value of human labour approaches 0, and billions will die as the wealthy will immolate the entirety of the world rather than concede their power and control over society and the means of production. We will either anihilate ourselves as a species, or rise from the ashes of our ruined society in socialist utopia. At least this is my solemn prediction.

I was let go back in January, replaced by some part-time jerk straight outta high-school. Suddenly my years of experience were no longer needed.

So I decided to pivot, and learn a bit about machine learning and AI.

Now I'm working with industry leading tech companies, training AI models full time. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em?

17i2fhi,Are you guys worried that AI will take your job?,k6u9vlg,Graham76782,1,"My biggest concern with AI is that I will lose access to it in a meaningful way. Right now I am using it as a personal tutor to learn new skills to further my career, and to drive it towards a more desirable direction, 100% WFH remote location independent work and relevant skills only. But I am relying on paid ChatGPT, which is very restrictive in terms of it's token short term memory, ability to debate and argue, ability to standby the facts and not be a pushover that accepts misinformation, and also I think its ethical and safety protections are very misguided and poorly implemented.

I'm very concerned that AI will turn into an arms race in regards to skills, and those with the best personal AI tutors will always out perform those that don't have that asset. This is why I feel forced to pay for ChatGPT. In regard to it taking my job, I'm not really concerned about that, but I am very concerned about it obsoleting my field, network engineering, so I'm trying to pivot my set of skills.

I think if you want job security then learning AI is a good bet. I think of it like working with horses right at the time of Henry Ford and the model T. Probably not a bad job to work with horses right at that time, but very soon after you're going to be out of luck if you haven't pivoted your set of skills and career tragectory.

So to sum it up, I'm not really worried about it obsoleting work from home jobs. I'm worried about it creating unsurmountable skill gaps between the haves and the have nots. The haves being able to learn from AI at an early age and as such having unimaginable levels of skill and knowledge across vast scopes. The have nots at best being decently educated in a traditional sense. And I'm worried about centralized AI more in general, where your mind is a plain glass of water and whoever has the most powerful AI can use it to dye the water to whatever color they want, and you have zero resources or skills to do anything but become a purple glass of water.

It might create more efficiency, which means that the same work can be done with fewer people. But it won’t wipe away the necessity for human employees in these industries.

AI is just responding to prompts from humans. And its output often requires review and further prompts to get the correct response or review and manual cleanup done by a person before it’s actually useful.

There are also tasks that AI handles well and tasks it doesn’t. So it might save time in the idea generation phase of say, writing a script for a video, giving you a dozen great ideas and titles in an instant, but it might take you 3x as long to proof it if you have AI write the script because it’s going to take longer for an editor to review it, fact check it, and correct any errors.

There will be some parts of the work that it creates efficiencies in and some parts where it will still be more efficient to just have a skilled human do it.

So, it will become a tool to make workers more efficient, not a robot worker that fully replaces the need to employ you.

Someday in the future being proficient at using AI and being a “prompt engineer” will be a valuable skill set and not having at least basic capabilities with those tools will be equivalent to being an office worker who isn’t familiar with MS Office and can only hunt and peck on a keyboard.

You are in serious denial about AI. Anything that can be done on a computer can be done by an AI and once those jobs are gone there isn’t a “new technology” replacement jobs waiting in the wings. Big tech has been trying to tell you this yet a lot of people have their heads in the sand. It may not happen today or tomorrow but the rate of change can only increase as AI gets better and labor costs have always been an issue for employers even if automating their business to reduce costs ends up in fact destabilizing society because there will be no consumers other then other automated companies.

Which jobs will be in demand? Which ones are shrinking? And which ones could be hardest to fill?


During the pandemic (2019–22), the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts, 50 percent more than in the previous three-year period. Most involved people leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations.

>By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI. However, we see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. Automation’s biggest effects are likely to hit other job categories. Office support, customer service, and food service employment could continue to decline.
Federal investment to address climate and infrastructure, as well as structural shifts, will also alter labor demand. The net-zero transition will shift employment away from oil, gas, and automotive manufacturing and into green industries for a modest net gain in employment. Infrastructure projects will increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today. We also see increased demand for healthcare workers as the population ages, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce.

>An additional 12 million occupational transitions may be needed by 2030. As people leave shrinking occupations, the economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men.

>The United States will need workforce development on a far larger scale as well as more expansive hiring approaches from employers. Employers will need to hire for skills and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as rural workers and people with disabilities), and deliver training that keeps pace with their evolving needs.",1698467364

19ebmm1,Is anyone concerned about the impact AI might have to your job?,kjbo55a,PolarPeely26,15,"I'm a Chartered Surveyor.

In the last six months, our company has signed up to an AI product that has automated our report writing.

We used to write reports along with a support staff. Now, an AI program does it, and we check it. 

This has reduced our time to do the report by nearly 85%, but the amount of new work has not increased at all. So we have highly qualified staff doing different things like networking and trying to win more work. It is already pushing down the sum quoted as Surveyors are very keen to win work as they have more time available.

The AI will only improve, and it shall improve fast, and I'd guess in a year or so we won't need to check reports as much, and we'll be wiser and using AI for many more tasks and jobs.

Over winter, our board (that I am not a member of) had a seminar on AI, and one of the key points was the ability to reduce man-hours spent on a job.

Staff and the leadership are generally excited and celebrating the AI.

But I suspect they won't be employing as many new people and shall ultimately lead to some or many redundancies.

But I don't think it will stop there. 

If AI can write the reports, eventually, I suspect our clients won't need us as they'll go to the AI for the report rather than us further down the line.

We are also automating lots of jobs support staff did just a few months ago. Both by policy and just by naturally as AI becomes part of our go-to software.

A simple example...

Yesterday, I needed a large amount of text extracted from images so I could then copy and paste the text (words) into an email. A few months ago, I'd have asked our support staff team to do that, and it would have taken an hour or so, and a day lead in waiting time as they would have been doing other jobs first. Well, I got Google Bard AI to do that for me, and it saved hours of work and gave me a perfect reply in 5 seconds.

My belief is that this will crush a lot of professional jobs over the next 5 to 10 years.

Anyone who thinks their role and industry will be unaffected needs a reality check, and I feel it is either ignorant to what AI is and will soon be doing, or they may just be arrogant. I see loads of solicitors scoffing at the idea that AI could do their ""difficult"" job, I find that hilarious, really.

In the private sector, business leaders will love the opportunity to reduce staff costs and use AI instead. It's more money into their pocket as it shall eliminate their biggest overhead - paying salaries.",1706084190

19ebmm1,Is anyone concerned about the impact AI might have to your job?,kjbpcw2,,6,"It's a big debate in my sector, museums. On the one hand, we do a lot of copywriting and research that could be automated - on the other hand, we're paid by the taxpayer to maintain a pool of experts to act as a publicly-available authority on their subject matter. So they can't be automated, because the whole point is they can give a more nuanced answer than any book or research paper (because they wrote the book.)


What we will see is things like digitisation of historical documents, registration of acquisitions, object description writing, and some research assistant work becoming automated. It'll be slow, a good few years behind the trend (because museums are, by their very nature, wary of change.)


I'm not overly worried about jobs being lost. We had a cross-organisation panel investigate what jobs could be automated and found that most of the work that can be won't impact employment numbers. 


For example, we currently have a collection of prints that need descriptions writing. We estimate it will take around 1000 hours for a research assistant to write them, or 70 with an AI assistant. We can't lay off any research assistants though, because we only have two and their current backlog of item descriptions would take over three hundred years to process at current rate. 


Ultimately, we'll automate jobs (once the powers that be come around to it. They will.) But it will be jobs that were so understaffed there won't be anyone to lay off. 


It's the same across the sector. Every museum is on an absolute shoestring staffing budget, there isn't anyone to lay off. We're already running with skeleton crews. We've been running with skeleton crews since before I joined the workforce fifteen years ago.",1706085078

I've said this to a colleague recently but the one thing that is going to absolutely screw over AI is the same thing that screws over us humans. Documentation. Everywhere you work we either have no documentation, or shit documentation. AI relies on good information to be able to learn and get context so when you feed it a bunch of docs that are either wrong, outdated, ambiguous... or don't feed it anything, you're going to get no value out of it. It won't understand why you need specific resources, or specific security restraints. It won't understand why you want a public storage account for some niche application, or why you need two AD groups instead of one because of some obscure company policy.

For what it’s worth; a friend who’s a Chief AI Scientist, notes that in ten years time the world will look radically different.

But, as others have pointed out - we can’t have a functioning society if AI takes vast swathes of jobs. There won’t be tax coming in to pay for anything and instead you’ll have civil uproar.

Who is going to buy the goods that fund AI, if jobs are scarce?

Could Universal Income be a solution to that? Maybe, I sure hope governments are looking at it.

So eventually my own personal belief is that we’ll have to find a balance between humans and AI - this might even be something Govts have to legislate upon.

As with most things, it won’t go extreme one-way or the other. My hope would be we can reduce to a four day working week, with AI doing enough work to help that but, not destroying massive amounts of jobs.

With ingestion of logs around 7-10gb a day for up to 2500 staff and c300 servers along with edr logs at around £130k a year it’s the most cost effective solution.

It won't. The way that all AI works is regurgitation. It's mathematical, mostly based on things like Bayes. You train a model with categorisation and then it ""learns"" from that. Like number plate recognition is about giving AI thousands of variations of each character from photographs and then when you give it another photograph it does various bits of image manipulation and then gives a weight to which character it most likely is. 

Most of the text in ChatGPT seems smart, but it's just doing the same thing but with words. It doesn't understand what it's doing. It's just following words with other words based on probability. It doesn't have context and might never have context because it's all about math.  And to some extent, human beings are Bayesian. 90% of your friends tell you Nando's is good, 10% tell you it's shit, you probably go to Nando's. But you also might ask why that guy tells you it's shit and you understand the context of their complaints and actually, his complaint might mean that you choose not to go to Nando's.

It's why I think most of what's happening now is a lot of hype. People are looking at this stuff and thinking it's going to be amazing in the next generation, but it won't because it lacks all that contextual stuff.

As an example, the company I work (unnamed ISP) for has a lot of PSTN/copper phone line customers. There are only six test results that can arise from an automated test. Most tests come back with a clear code despite there being a fault. So all the automation costs so far mostly just lead to it not seing anything wrong and going to a person anyway (goes for other services).

AI learning can always adapt, but it will be a long way off before it can gain the programming needed to troubleshoot most complex scenarios and most customer surveys and polls have agreed that an on-shore human touch is what they appreciate most\* to their service.

Tech companies are making bets on AI helping them trim the fat they built, they haven’t deployed it fully to cover that yet. But they will.

Biggest threat this year are layoffs becoming the fashion beyond tech, and dipshit CEOs feeling pressured to layoff and cite AI as a reason.

That pressure will get terrible over the next 2-3 years as markets simply expect businesses to have realized the actual value that AI has in any given industry and role type.

All in, Amazon is probably a primary company to watch to get a sense for how it will waterfall in.  Whatever Amazon does will serve as a template for many businesses.

This was from a nice study done last year by some guys watching freelance employment sites and wages.  This is keyed to the release of gpt 3.5.

Working with a customer who spends $350 just to get a blog post created from writers they keep on retainer.

I uploaded their style guide and built an agent, showed them how to tune things a bit…that 350 went to $1.33.

*edited: I can almost guarantee businesses who do not have a defined AI strategy will get hammered in the markets starting sooner than later.  This is 15-65 percent productivity CEOs are leaving on the table every day, even with gpt 4 and no more.  Once that has agentic connections to ERP, etc, every day will be a day from hell for the unmindful CTO.  Which will be fucking hilarious for me, personally. Enjoy your annual planning events becoming weekly ones, that’s why you guys sit in the smart guy chair*

There's a concept in economics called inelasticity. In essence, small percentage changes in availability result in massive price swings. If the oil supply goes down 2 percent, prices can double. It works this way too with labor, but mostly against workers, almost never for them, because of course the slugmen control the politics of the labor market and can prevent substantial wage spikes by simply waiting them out. Plus, an ""inelasticity event"" in one job market can spread to others. If 10% truck drivers get laid off, a whole economy that exists to feed and house them collapses too; at the same time, all these people who are out of work move into other industries, so you get a cascading refugee crisis. Wages collapse. Owners thrive, workers barely hold on.

It isn't the norm for wage labor to be respected; in medieval societies, free peasants and even serfs (who had less freedom, but more rights and more protections) looked down on wage work. We are coming out of an anomalous time wherein wage labor could actually improve upon somebody's born position--it didn't happen all that often, but it was possible--and AI is going to end it.

1afv431,Is AI causing a massive wave of unemployment now?,kocww4b,Dractheridon,16,"The issue is Wall Street looks at tech as if their only value is in perpetual, constant growth. No company can guarantee that, so when they hit a plateau of growth, they look to things that can simulate growth.

This is usually in the form of layoffs and cost cutting, which, up until recently Wall Street frowned upon. The idea was layoffs were considered bad for business.

However, sometime in '22 Wall Street and ""arm chair investors"" started to be fed all these stories about AI being good, that it could replace jobs. They started looking into the tech.

Tech companies and other businesses are lead by CEOs - furious of unionizing, or in tech, workers refusal to return to the office environment - largely ignoring the research that shows an actual increase in productivity. They heard terms like ""quiet quitting"", and, looking at their empty offices - offices that once gave their egos huge enrichment ( no doubt  stroked by their phallic monuments that scraped the skies ) - now were empty, now were missing the people they would lord over, no longer seeing the masses that attended their mandatory all-hands meetings (that nobody really cared about)

It was about the economics of real estate - those businesses were in areas largely impacted by  growing real-estate, cost of child care, and a growing realization that the office environment actually hindered you from getting work done.

Angry, and desiring some sort of power play, these leaders started forcing the issue with harsh, unfair Return To Office (RTO) mandates, quietly seeking ways to get employees they didn't like to quit, because firings en-masse ""looked bad"".

Fast forward and you saw Alphabet, Meta, etc - start to layoff people under the excuse of ""over-hiring during COVID"" - which was code for ""we don't know what to do with them, because our growth is flat"".

Jobs were cut severely, yet, this time, the market didn't punish them, as they feared. Instead the market bounced up.

Today, they are attacking their workers again, still frustrated by the workers essentially standing their ground, telling them ""no"".

They claim it's AI (content generation, automation) that is removing the jobs.

Make no mistake - it is not - these companies are posting record profits.

They put up AI as their excuse to exact revenge for leaving their offices and their egos in the dirt in favor of actual productivity - this can only go so far before it, too runs out of runway.

Meanwhile, AI didn't make thing easier, workers just have to do more work - sometimes, twice or three times the work they used to, as their co-workers get laid off. Bad decisions from management, that lead to decline in growth, are not reflected back on the managers. Instead the workers are made to further suffer.

Expect more companies to merger or to shut down. AI isn't a game changer as they said. It's already hitting its limits. But the angry ego-driven (mostly male) CEOs - that are largely compensated at insane levels ( eg Elon Musk asking for a 55B dollar payday ) - they still want their money and provide almost zero value.

This is all moving towards greater wealth inequality, both in personal wealth ( Musk ) and in corporate wealth ( Alphabet/Google ) - it's why we should tax the rich, and break up the Big Tech companies ( similar to AT&Ts breakup )

I hope we can see some legislation soon, protecting workers from the hostile work environment.

If you can't write your labor off against expenses, they become a lot more expensive to carry.

You make $1M/year in revenue. You have $1M/year in R&D labor. Before, you made $0 profit, paid $0 taxes.

Now, you Make $1M/year in revenue. You have $1M/year in R&D labor. BUt, you can only write off $200k if domestic, and $66k if international. Paying taxes at 15% you're showing a tax burden of $120k and you've got no cash (because you burned it on labor).

For e.g now if a soldier or someone presses that trigger there is still a lot of thinking that happens versus drones and tanks killing left and right.

Where AI stands out is when I was not able to search documentation/examples of a setting for a framework I did not know what to write with a combination of those settings.

Then there's the fact that some projects need to be axed because employers have a much bigger visions in mind, and you'd get lay off from that. 

This next one is my own speculation: There are also opportunists piggy backing off of this. During Covid there was a pretty high demand and tech folks were offered pretty high salaries. So I imagine they think it would be 'economical' to just lay folks off for other reasons and take advantage of a large 'supply' of tech folks to renegotiate salaries with? 

Then you've got the thing about writers, and I can see the low effort writers market which required taking news, condensing it and placing it on sites being easily replaced. That said I think that was already kind of happening before LLM's came around, just kind of with shittier tools.

Call centers are definitely letting people go. I personally know folks in the telecom industry who have told me they are handing out a lot of severance packages and letting people go. Again, we already had robocalls and automated answering machines eroding at this industry, so it's not surprising it's one of the first to go. 

Art in a bad place. Current artists still have the skills they've already learned, but are competing with folks who are generating AI art. They can technically use the same tools and have better results with the existing techniques they already use. Even if it's just to inspire themselves with 100 quickly generated images that inspire them to hand draw something amazing and fix things like composition, and a whole lot of details that makes an AI *feel* AI. That said, a lot of consumers might not really care.",1706816585

Many jobs either update, close, stagnant or otherwise. Workers who are able to be more adaptable and teachable will end up doing the work of what many others can do so. So it'll open many new probabilities. This depends on the individual on what it would do. My prediction would be a workers federal program to compensate individuals and provide educational opportunities to keep up or federal grants for local programs. It needs workers working and for an increase in productivity using AI would be taxed in some way to measure resources used.

Just imagine those without work wouldn't be able to buy things or contribute economically which is why there are so many taxes. If sales don't sale and taxes aren't taxing then the labor programs will be opened. If we had a more sensible and articulate government we'd be getting more information that would be helpful.

Given a few more years of sub-bar results in this current climate, Google will eventually be forgotten as well.

If you Bing something, the first thing you see is literal gpt, AI generated content, created in real time. If google were smart they'd be looking for sites exclusively based on content quality, regardless of if it's AI generated. If AI generated content was so poor of an experience to end users, bing wouldn't be in a current upward trajectory in terms of search engine market share like it is currently.

Google doesn't have to integrate an AI generator straight into search results like bing is doing, but rather they can look at ranking sites that use a good hybrid approach - AI generated content that has human oversight with good quality prompts, leading to helpful content. That would be better than what Bing does where there is no prompt currently, it's just raw AI.

For years Google has been on a moral crusade at the cost of its search results. I found it better back in 2012 pre-penguin update. Now it's an uphill battle to even get exact match results which before you could get via double quotes. Their results are increasingly generic, dumb and assume their users are idiots. They've taken active steps to prevent advanced users to find specifically what they're looking for.
