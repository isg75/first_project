# Remote Work Productivity and Motivation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between team-building activities, career growth opportunities, and flexible work hours with employee motivation and productivity in remote work environments. The hypothesis guiding this analysis is that enhanced team interactions, growth potential, and work flexibility contribute to higher levels of motivation and productivity among remote employees.

Using two datasets focused on productivity metrics and mental health indicators, the project aims to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform remote work policies for organizations aiming to optimize employee performance and well-being.

## Hypothesis
Team-building activities, career growth opportunities, and flexible work hours will lead to higher employee motivation and productivity in remote work environments. Our project was inspired by the following questions: 

1. Does employee satisfaction differ significantly across remote, hybrid, and onsite work environments?
2. Are flexible work hours associated with higher productivity, especially in remote and hybrid setups?
3. How are the number of online meetings related to stress levels and work-life-balance?
4. Team dynamic & work environment related to overall work satisfaction?
5. Is there a measurable link between career growth opportunities and motivation among the remote work environment?

## Datasets
The project leverages two primary datasets:

- Productivity Dataset: This dataset contains information on various productivity metrics, such as hours worked, number of virtual meetings, work-life balance rating, and productivity change.
- Mental Health Dataset: This dataset focuses on mental health indicators, including social isolation rating, stress level, satisfaction with remote work, and other metrics that may impact employee well-being and motivation.

* Data Sources
Both datasets are sourced from anonymized profiles on Kaggle. We performed due diligence to ensure the reliability and integrity of the data sets, by checking different metrics such as usability scores, licenses, and total views and downloads. After conducting this review process, we concluded these two datasets were valid for our project. 

## Project Structure/ How to Explore
1. Open the readme_HRdata.md file
2. Launch yaml and requirement files to ensure smooth exploration of the project.
3. to explore the analysis, go through the main notebooks in the notebook folder.
4. check the function folders for an overview of the main functions used. 
5. See the slides in the 'slides' folder for a recap of the project presentation.

## Analysis Approach
- Data Cleaning: Initial inspection and cleaning of both datasets, handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and standardizing formats.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive exploration of key variables related to productivity and mental health, including correlations and visualizations to identify potential relationships.
- Visualization: Various charts (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps, pivot tables) were created to display trends and relationships between productivity and mental health metrics in remote work settings.
- Insights and Recommendations: Key findings were summarized, with actionable recommendations for organizations aiming to improve employee motivation and productivity.

## Key Findings
- Need to ensure the reliability and integrity of our data. We realized we were working with synthetic data, which was evenly distributed, and had no variability. This resulted in difficulties drawing main conclusions and
- Contrary to initial expectations, we were not able to prove more pronounced differences in productivity across work styles (remote, hybrid, and in-office).
- Our analysis revealed that productivity levels are remarkably consistent across these work settings, suggesting that flexibility in work environment does not negatively impact employee performance.
-  This finding supports the viability of remote and hybrid work models as effective options without sacrificing productivity.
- Additionally, although our data was sythetic and showed minimal variation across work types, we conducted research to underpin our findings by reputable studies in the field of Human Resources, further validating that employees maintain comparable productivity levels regardless of their work setting.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and aggregation.
- Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to identify trends and correlations.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and reporting.

## Recommendations for Employers:
- Promote policies that ensure employees have access to similar and adequate resources appropriate to their work-setting environment. 
- Encourage flexible work schedules to support work-life balance.
- Invest in team-building initiatives to foster social connections and reduce isolation.
- Provide clear career growth paths and upskilling opportunities to maintain employee motivation.

## Limitations
- Data Scope: The analysis is limited to the specific data collected and may not generalize to all industries or remote work models.
- Time: Needed more time to explore datasets and ensure the naturarility of the data met the purposes of this project. 
- Technical challenges: familiarization with Git Branches, DocStrings, and yaml file configuration. 
  
Further research could involve gathering a larger and more diverse dataset, incorporating more objective productivity metrics, and exploring additional factors that may influence remote work effectiveness.
